0,Humana offers so much more than just medical coverage. They have so many different ways of offering at no cost preventive activities and other help lines. I have been with Humana for years. They have went out of their way to suggest and assist me in getting extra help medically and financially. They’ve introduced me to so much extra help that I didn’t know existed or was eligible for.,5,Humana
1,"For the most part I am satisfied with my health plan. The payments they have made are fair with the exception of my copay for physical therapy. $40 per session is too much. Prescription part of my plan is good and there is no copay this year for my PCP. They offer OTC allowances from their catalog 4 X year, reduced or zero dollar mail order prescription copays and free membership in the SilverSneakers fitness program.",4,Humana
2,"Humana has included very good insurance support for myself during this past year. They also have included few & higher options compared with other insurance companies. But negative activities unfortunately being included for myself, was not including enough of medical Drs within my area while including Neurology. I am also emphasizing that few telephone representatives were unfortunately overseas or speaking improperly within our English language, that also hurts me a lot.",4,Humana
3,"So I got this insurance about 28 days ago. I did careful research. In the last 28 days I have gotten a 200.00 pair of glasses. Got my teeth cleaned. Went to my an eyeglass script. All at no cost to me. I also talked to customer service and got a great person to take care of one issue. Not sure about why there are so many 1 stars? So are trivial, though. And as a general rule people only complain on many sites like this.",5,Humana
4,"I have had Humana for my Medicare part D program and couldn't be happier. Now, keep in mind I am only on one drug. But their automated phone service calls me regularly and reorders my monthly medicine with a few clicks... DONE. I am very happy with them, although they raised their price this year. But after looking at other plans, I think I will pay a few dollars more and keep Humana... don't want to invite hassle! Hope this helps you.",5,Humana
5,"I have had Humana Dental several months now, paying close to $60 per month for my coverage. During this time I have never received any proof of coverage or any form of an Insurance ID. I also phoned around asking different Dentists if they accept this insurance. Even Dentists Humana says are in the Network. Well I was told over and over the coverage is useless. So I ended up cancelling my policy. Why should I pay for insurance that covers nothing and is useless. So several months I have wasted my money. Humana customer service agents barely spoke English. And talk about rude. The agents are horrible. Humana is an Insurance Company I sure as heck don't trust. I'm glad to be rid of them!!",1,Humana
6,Last week I had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. The doctor prescribed liquid ** for pain control. Humana denied the liquid saying they allowed tablet form. Humana apparently does not understand bariatric patients cannot take pills following surgery. I had to crush it to take it.,1,Humana
7,"My wife has been diagnosed with cancer. She had appointments through two different doctors (oncologist and radiology oncologist) for chemo and radiation which must be run concurrently. First Humana would not authorize one of the chemo meds, which cause us to delay treatment several days. Then Humana refused to authorize two radiation treatments a day. This caused another week of delay in treatment. Both authorization were finally authorized. BUT the patient should never suffer through this bureaucracy especially when faced with cancer where every minute is precious when treatment is concerned!",1,Humana
8,"Humana Pharmacy has absolutely the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ever. The agents can NEVER answer my questions or give/provide a direct answer. I have called numerous times about the same issue - sometimes being on the phone/hold/transferred around for as long as 1 hour and 6 minutes, only to have the problem reoccur every month. My doctor has called and filed paperwork to have the problem resolved, but after over a YEAR NOW, it is not resolved. As soon as I can, I am dumping Humana. I have overpaid thousands of dollars because of their incompetency, mistakes and utter lack of organization. Today, for the 12th time, I have been on hold FORTY MINUTES TODAY AGAIN WITH NO RESOLUTION. There are much better choices out there for prescription drug coverage.",1,Humana
9,"I made a total of 4 calls, talked to 7 people and they think it's ** funny to play games and not just change my address. I'll never get my mail from them again because God forbid they just do their job. If you can avoid this company they are 100% useless.",1,Humana
10,"I had to pay out over a thousand dollars for my son's oral surgery back in December of 2018. I have personally faxed (2/7/19) and certified mailed (2/12/19) the claim with ALL x-rays and op notes. Imagine that we are halfway through May of 2019 and it still isn't processed. I have called and discussed this as follows: 1/23/19 spoke to Nicole (processing), 2/15/19 Mckalaya and Kyle (processing), 2/25/19 Nicole/supervisor (processing), 3/8/19 Ann called me said she was sending it up to Corey to process in 5-10 days. 3/15/19 Regina (processing), 3/22/19 Faith and Melissa supervisor (processing), 4/15/19 Jacob and Crista supervisor (processing), 4/22/19 Mia and Jay ** (processing), 5/6/19 Ben (processing) sending for rush, 5/17/19 Stephanie and Melisa supervisor Still processing and sent to Rush. I worked at insurance and paid claims and this is the most pathetic claims processing I have ever seen.",1,Humana
11,Have enjoyed my various experiences. For example when my wife was in the hospital (dying) they were right there. Having a nurse come around every so often. They were always pleasant and thorough. Never had any troubles with prescriptions.,5,Humana
12,"Two hours on the phone being transferred dozen times...I need a drug not on the formulary. The drug on the formulary will kill me, the one I need will help me.. They ultimately hang up on me several times.. The first person Shanice was rude, arrogant, condescending and hung up on me.. People at Humana are like government employees.. They do not care.. I had my doctor here to prescribe the meds.. They hung up on him.",1,Humana
13,"Avoid Humana if you possibly can. My providers hate it. My dentist was on hold for 2 hours with Humana today and finally had to give up when it was office closing time. I had to wait a month for a pre-approval even though I said I was having quite a bit of pain. Their OTC is a joke, providing $35 a month and really skimpy choices in the OTC pharmacy, through which you have to order online. One other review that I saw said providers groaned when they heard they would have to deal with Humana. I actually saw that happen today. Save yourself some stress and go elsewhere.",1,Humana
14,"If you are healthy and young, Humana may be good for you but EVERY healthcare professional we have encountered (and that's A LOT) moans when they discover my parents have Humana. If you don't need rehab, you might be ok, however parents have been denied extended rehab even when doctors and therapists recommend more. CHOOSE ANOTHER COMPANY!!!",1,Humana
15,Acute Bronchitis. Prescribed **. Needed pre-approval and was denied. Emergency room visit. Prescribed **. Need pre-approval. Went to my Primary care doctor. Explained why and what. Took 1.5 hours and 3 hang ups before Humana provided all the info necessary. Denial letter received 19 hours later. Humana had no intention of approving. Meanwhile I was coughing until I vomited or passed out. Borrowed money from my grocery fund to pay for it. With coupon from GoodRx I paid less than $12 for a nearly $50 medication. I have been warned by 2 pharmacies that Humana doesn't like to do pre-approval meds. Too bad zero stars isn't an option.,1,Humana
16,Had this insurance for over 2 years through Marketplace. I was going to a specialist and insurance paid their portion. Fast forward a year and they refused to pay for my specialist that year so I argued with them. They kept on changing their excuse for not paying. I finally had to pay the whole bill. Last year this insurance was no longer available in my state. About 3 months later my Dr sent me a bill from 2 years ago (insurance and I paid our share). Come to find out 1 1/2 years later they decided not to pay this and took their payment back. No notifications to me nothing. ,1,Humana
17,"Just stay away from this company. They conveniently forget to to tell you what is in network, and out of network. Consequently, I got charged 100.00 for my psychotherapy. Medicare alone, copay is less than 25.00 for this service. Stay away from this company.. One",1,Humana
18,"When I call Humana pharmacy customer service, I go through the chain of 5 answers only to find out their pharmacy is closed and to call back during regular business hours. The problem is they never tell you in their recorded message what their regular business hours are!! What kind of customer service is that?",1,Humana
19,"I tried to find an in network dentist, from list on Humana website. When I called dentist offices said they no longer accepted Humana or advised me that Humana covered basically nothing! Called Humana membership # 4 times. Got only recorded voices asking same questions over and over. Finally thought I was being transferred to a real person, but phone went dead, nobody answered. Website lists services covered but this is just for advertising, must submit claim, then they'll tell you if you're covered. Then it's too late, you're on the hook for the bill!",1,Humana
20,This insurance has been a nightmare from the start. Referrals mean nothing as authorizations are also needed with referrals. Insurance Company seems never to get the requests that the doctors assure me they sent. Customer service is horrific. Getting to see a specialist and getting tests done is not going to happen with this company. Best they're going to tell you is sure they're working on it. Will let you know that never happens. Just found out that the colonoscopy I was scheduled for has not been authorized. Nobody was going to let me know. I am glad I called before I went through the horrific prep that you have to do before a colonoscopy. Do not buy this insurance for yourself as you will be sadly disappointed.,1,Humana
21,"I signed up for Medicare Drug Plan D with Humana in 2015. They set up payment for the plan via my credit card and input a wrong expiration date in their system for my credit card. Their system stopped charging my card for payments even though the card HAD NOT EXPIRED. Consequently Humana terminated my policy for non payment and now they refuse to re-instate even though all payments were paid as soon as I discovered their error (paid with the exact card they said was expired). The customer service staff, enrollment staff and sales department staff were ALL VERY RUDE and blamed me for THEIR error. ",1,Humana
22,"I was with Humana twice and it was a nightmare. I could not get a referral and I was sick with cancer. When I finally got a referral (over a year trying) I was sent to a wonderful Dr that had to biopsy me right away. When I went back to get the results of my biopsy, I did not have a referral? I refused to leave, and waited over an hour for Humana to allow my visit. It was grade 2 adenocarcinoma and I was sent to Moffitt Cancer Center. I had the worst experience after the surgery and got away from Humana for good. I should have sued them! I had many more horror stories about this awful excuse for health care, but it would take pages and pages. The best part? The bill! Outrageous amount! Now I see that I am signed up for Humana again, this will not be allowed on my part. I feel safer using my own choice.",1,Humana
23,"Terrible customer service oriented department, I spend over 1 hour and 45 minutes between two phone calls with regards to a copay for a prescription with an extremely HIGH COPAY, finally I was told because my plan was RESTARTED only 2 months ago (have been insured for over 10 years with Humana Gold) I didn't have any right for a reduced/waive deductible. HUMANA IS THE ONLY COMPANY IN THE INDUSTRY THAT DOESN'T VALUE LOYALTY. ""SHAME ON HUMANA.""",1,Humana
24,"Decent coverage but patient pay is a lot more than it used to be for seniors. Tests that you need as a senior such as lab work, certain X-rays are not covered under the current medicare plan offered by Humana. The billing departments border on harassment when requesting payments.",4,Humana
25,"There's so many bad things... Where to start? First no one in Huntsville, Al. accepts this Ins. They won't pay. No one can understand you on their call line if you speak english. I spent 3 days just trying to get info. They or their phone service keeps hanging up on you after holding for 30 mins! Just look for any other Dental Ins... I don't know about the Medical.",1,Humana
26,"I would not recommend this company to anyone. I have yet to get a return call from a manager who promised on 2 occasions to research and resolve the issues, which never happened. I spent HOURS on hold, tried to reach someone at corporate only to be treated rudely by the receptionist and not transferred to anyone. This is stems from an error on THEIR end, not mine, which is documented in the notes. However, if you do try to call their offshore customer service line, you get someone who only reads a script, can barely understand and doesn't help at all. THE WORST EXPERIENCE.",1,Humana
27,"My sister Vickie suffered from a terrible fall last year. Unfortunately, she went into a coma and was on life support for two months. Tristar Medical Center in Nashville gave her great compassionate care. I wish I could say the same for Humana Insurance. Ironically, my sister sold insurance for many years and was a top producer. The hospital informed us that Humana had denied any help with long term care, stating, ""That she will not improve."" A few weeks later she awoke and Humana's response was again a ""DENIAL"" for any assistance. In my book, this is called FRAUD. Please warn others not to purchase any policies from this company. We will be filing a complaint with the state of Tennessee's Attorney Generals office. A caseworker with Tristar Hospital told me, ""Your sister would have been better off if she wouldn't have purchased that policy, we see this from that company all the time.""",1,Humana
28,"Needed a psychiatrist for depression. Can't find one within 50 miles. All names on their list either won't take Humana anymore, or never did or are rated very poorly. Guess I can't find help when I really needed it. Complained once, gave them responses from the doctors about a year ago. Still on the list. They just don't care and are very incompetent. HELP ME!",1,Humana
29,"I purchased Humana Military CHCBP as a COBRA after going off Tricare. It was sold as a product that ""mirrored Tricare Standard"" in terms of providers, coverage and rates. And in fact, that's how it worked for me from 2/2016 through 12/2017. However, starting in January of 2018, they moved their billing department from Tricare South to Tricare East. For the next 13 months until I disenrolled 2/1/2019, all my claims were wrongly processed as out-of-network because I am in Colorado. ",1,Humana
30,"I never used my dental coverage for over a year and got a cavity and called Humana dental and they called the dentist office and were told all Humana customers were on hold until May 1st due to Humana not paying their bills. My second choice was going to a clinic which I was not willing to do. Getting help from anyone was very difficult and sometimes very hard to understand over the phone. I spent hours over the phone, many, many return calls and still waiting to be able to go to the dentist that they chose. Would never recommend this dental coverage!!!",1,Humana
31,"Minimal coverage of prescriptions... They are not interested in preventing problems but spend our $ on a 'wellness' program which sucks. They want to send out a doc to weigh me and measure blood pressure but will not cover ** nor ** injections to prevent and improve on my osteoporosis as just an example. Going to a specialist is also cost prohibitive.. Last year is was a $50 copay, this year a $40 copay...",2,Humana
32,Just called Humana for explanation of denial of payment to a service provider. Was asked for call back number in case of disconnect. 15 minute hold. Disconnected. No call back. And this is not the first time. Or the second. Was calling having received letters from Humana of denial of payment for services rendered when I had called on the phone for confirmation of benefits and provider in-network. (I always call 3 different times to get 3 different reps and go with what 2 out of the 3 say. The website is no guarantee of accuracy.) This is the last time. Now shopping for new coverage.,1,Humana
33,Their customer service is something to be desired. You get transferred so many times and have to repeat the same thing over and over again. It becomes quite trying! I just recently found out that CVS Pharmacy completely overcharged me for a prescription that should have cost $10.00. I paid $39.00 for it. CVS has a bad habit of that I have just recently found out also. By the way this is their Drug plan not health.,3,Humana
34,Finally a salesperson I could understand completely! The knowledge of finding me a better policy and then explaining it to the max and answering all my questions. Even saved money every month for more value.,5,Humana
35,Switched from one provider in Humana Gold Plus to another due to incompetent nurse practitioner and lack of professionalism. Loved my new doctor after one visit which included discussion of treatment for pre-diabetes. Agreed to try a statin when she told me she would be fired if she didn't prescribe one due to high cholesterol. Received a call one week later from nurse advising medical director was ordering me to take 2 ** which was twice the dose prescribed by the doctor and 4 ** which was 4 times the dose prescribed by the doctor. ,1,Humana
36,"Five years ago I had a major heart event. Humana was right there for the emergency care, through an induced coma and aftercare with visiting nurse and food sent to my door. Through the following years Humana has provided excellent care and followup.",5,Humana
37,I was totally mislead about the change from Medicare to Medicare Advantage. If I could change today I would. In the zest to make a sale the explanation of the change was totally short of the realities.,1,Humana
38,"The copays were too high, cost of insulin was ridiculous, the case managers never knew what was going on with you. Switched case managers almost monthly, it was difficult to get insulin for my pump under Part B Medicare.",3,Humana
39,"My doctor ordered a prescription through Humana and Humana kept sending emails that this order required my approval. Five days later no answer to any email and final a Humana Rep said the site was down and maybe my doctor could give me samples of the blood pressure med till they got it together. The next rep ordered the meds and said it would be shipped overnight. I next find out they are out of this prescription and will send it when they get. Did arrive, so next Humana Rep sent me to CVS for the prescription, which a $15. This was after speaking to eight persons at Humana. 10 days later. They simple are not functional.",1,Humana
40,"The fees go up and the covered services drastically disappeared. For a retired Military family who have no choice this is despicable. We no longer are eligible to receive Optometry care, Dental Care, and almost all tests and frankly critical preventive heart and other care are routinely deemed 'unnecessary'.",1,Humana
41,"So far I have been totally pleased with the service. I am facing some major surgery, I'll know more about my feelings after that process. The pharmacy service is excellent and very prompt. It is very easy to keep in touch with them about my needs.",5,Humana
42,Medicare Gold Plus plan with prescription coverage. Referral process is cumbersome. Large selection of doctors and specialists and no co-pays in many instances. I am very satisfied with my Medicare and prescription drug coverage.,4,Humana
43,"Humana is very popular among Medicare recipients but I found the price that you paid for their services was not a good value. Their co pays were higher most, the local rep was hard to reach and when I called into customer service I always had long waits before I was able to speak to a rep. Their drug plan was good but I only have 2 prescriptions a month so that wasn't helpful to me.",3,Humana
44,"Why are not all insurance overages transportable from state to state, region to region? Why is there different forms for each company? Why so many tier drug levels? Why is dental not considered medical and appropriately covered?",3,Humana
45,I have been with Humana for only 4 months but so far I am very pleased. I have IOLA primary care under this plan and they have been very nice to deal with. I have received referrals promptly from my PCP and Health Coach.,5,Humana
46,"They inundate you with paper, every month. What can put in a sheet of paper (front &back) takes them 12 pages. Every month. They also inundate you with nonsense phone calls, even when you opt out. It seems the opt out only lasts for a month, then they start calling you again.",3,Humana
47,"Great if you have 40 hours a week to spend on the phone with them. I’m not used to being lied to. Time for them to approve a referral was min 30 days up to 5 months. They seemed to go out of their way to deny care, deny you spoke before, or deny your doc sent paperwork. What a great business model. Collect insurance premiums and then refuse to authorize service. “No, you’ve never requested that before. We don’t have any paperwork. We don’t know what you’re talking about.” That way they never have to officially deny a claim or deny service.",1,Humana
48,"I had surgery and had to pay money out of my pocket. Plus they claim I owe $1,000.00 which I don't understand why. I don't have money like that but, at least I thought it would have been paid. Please tell me what's going on and help me. I been on my job for awhile now and money coming out of my check every pay period. I just don't understand. I do need the help from them.",3,Humana
49,"Doctor cannot get paid to do a standard blood test. Must go elsewhere, why can't the doctor in a HMO get paid for a blood test when other doctors that take the same HMO can get paid for a blood test? Must you get a PPO? They don't tell you this before they give you the policy.",3,Humana
50,Humana has taken good care of my medical expenses to a degree. I do have a serious issue about them not caring that monies are being stolen from them by health care professionals. For the simple fact when they are billed that means I am billed and I refuse to allow people to steal from me. Especially when it is the same doctors that refuse to treat me.,3,Humana
51,"At times over the last 6 years Humana & staff has helped my husband & I more than any other organization. He has had a nurse come to our home, food delivered when we were broke, prescriptions at no copayment and so many other things to help that it's been unbelievable.",5,Humana
52,They need to provide prescriptions that work and not sugar pills. Getting at least 3 of mine from Walmart and CVS as Humana's are no good. All are pills relating to blood pressure and heart. Did not have this problem when using Blue Cross.,3,Humana
53,I want the extra help Insurance the dental. I cannot find anyone that accepts this insurance to redo my dentures. And these glasses ended up costing me old hundred dollars out of my pocket. I do not like that at all. I am very dissatisfied with the extra help. As far as paying for my medications fantastic. I love what it pays on copay and my medical doctor.,4,Humana
54,"I'm on disability and cannot afford the cost of meds through them... When comparing most were $0. When I receive them, some are up to $26. The deductible is too high therefore I cannot receive the care I need. I am almost 60 and would love some TRUE advice on a better plan.",3,Humana
55,"Despite repeated attempts to tell Humana I am not interested in their dental plan, they continue to harass me with unwanted mailers. I have asked them to remove me from their mailing list but the junk mail just keeps coming. After reading the reviews of this company, the people I really feel sorry for is the members. Thank goodness, I'm not one of them. ;-)",1,Humana
56,My nose doctor told me I need surgery. Humana has yet to approve my doctor request for surgery because I don't want to work with a nurse. I am not 50 or older. They don't care about their clients at all. Fyi all.,1,Humana
57,"NEVER HAD A PROBLEM THAT COULD NOT BE SOLVED. They cover all my hospital bills and X-rays, etc, have rides to hospital and doctor's app. Never had problem with understanding the bills, and questions I have. Can get answers on net also.",5,Humana
58,It is ok and health insurance is hard to get and the companies don't do all that they should for their clients or customers... Health insurance is very expensive and it doesn't cover nearly as much as it should.,4,Humana
59,"I could probably go on forever with how horrible Humana has been since the government has switched the Tricare North region under their care. My last pregnancy I had multiple doctors appts with the same doctor, at the same location, every time. My base messed up my active duty status (their fault) and it took almost a year to get corrected. Unfortunately, I had an ultrasound (SAME PLACE AS ALL THE OTHERS), during the timeframe I was shown as not active (when I was). It took a year to get Humana to finally acknowledge and approve my claim. Only for some reason, they only paid half of the claim. I'm active duty military and part of my entitlement is full coverage so there is no reason why they should only have covered half of it. I gave up fighting that battle as it no longer became worth it (couple hundred down the drain...)",1,Humana
60,I was ran around several times from this insurance company for their HMO dental plan. I can't believe that a business as big as this (maybe that's the issue) just runs people around. They made me wait two days before being assigned to a dentist and then me and the dentist's office kept waiting for them to assign me. Wasted about 45 minutes each phone call with Humana. If it wasn't for my school paying for this company I would not have them. I will be seeking out a new company after my insurance is up in June.,1,Humana
61,"Not only is it completely frustrating dealing with Humana on the phone but the amount of confusion they intentionally cause is incredible! In my area they sub my coverage out to another company, the sub company is great but they dont share information with each other. So if I want to see a specialist I have to get approved by a company that I never chose to be involved with. When it comes to prescriptions, forget the fact that your doctor completed medical school and sees you in person in his or her office because Humana will decide what medications you can and can't have. ",1,Humana
62,"Worst insurance ever. Half of the customer service reps barely speak English. I finally got fed up with one very rude person who simply could not speak the language. When I asked to speak with her supervisor, she refused to put me through. Another rude rep put me on hold for almost half an hour. My phone battery ran out, so I lost the call. This company covers next to nothing, and whatever claims are submitted, ALWAYS come back as being charged more than what Humana believes is reasonable. We had a $5,000 deductible with a $7,500 family limit. Two years in a row, our out of pocket was in excess of $15,000.",1,Humana
63,I will change my insurance away from Humana during next enrollment. I have had far too many difficulties with them as compared to other carriers. I will pay much more to a different carrier just to get reasonable service.,1,Humana
64,"Have a large brain aneurysm, so no prior authorization for surgery required. Able to get surgery within 7 days. They sent me 7 days of meals, called and checked on me on day 3. Paid the bill within 45 days. I was terrified over the whole issue of this type of surgery and costs, but their handling of it was A+. My costs were reasonable. Thank you Humana.",5,Humana
65,"I spoke with at least 10 people for 3 hours to simply log on to my account so that I could print up my cards, which I never received in the mail. I was met by rude technical assistant personnel and no one was able to help me. One person even tried to use the ""I'm losing you"" ""hello are you still there"". Mind you I was not on a cell phone - how lame is that. Horrible service. If I could cancel my plan on today I would!! I will never recommend Humana Vision to anyone and I will be changing my service when I am able. Don't waste your time with a company filled with people who can't or won't help!",1,Humana
66,"Also, I got a bill saying I had not been authorized to go to a neurologist so I am responsible for the full payment. I have never been seen by a neurologist. The primary care doctor's office tells me they have more trouble with Humana than any other insurance company.",1,Humana
67,"I called Humana to see if I need a referral. After putting in all the information and waiting for over 10 minutes for the process, opps can run it. Ask for a representative, finally spoke to someone and was told no referral needed. Asked for benefits line, sent me to rx benefits. After knowing I was calling about a surgery with my specialists, she goes through everything and ""Oops can't help you. Only rx benefits. Let me transfer you."" I get transferred to someone else which I think is the benefits for providers instead because they were talking and hitting buttons on the phone like crazy. I asked them to stop hitting buttons, ""Was not me. I was on speaker phone,"" and then they hung up on me. This is after spending over 40 minutes on the phone and know I have to start all over again.",1,Humana
68,My mother was contacted by an insurance agent about a cheaper insurance. All that she was told was that she would save $120 a month. Her supplemental was $160.00. She signed up for this not knowing or having it explained to her that this was not a supplemental insurance. She was recently hospitalized and this is when we learned. Now because of this she has not supplemental and left with a copay on her hospitalization. Do not get this insurance.,1,Humana
69,"My elderly mother has been scammed by Humana of Tennessee. She had the best insurance available for her age through my Dad's retirement plan. WHICH HE WORKED LONG AND HARD FOR! During open enrollment with BCBS of Tennessee we made no changes to her plan. She went to the doctor and they told her she no longer had BCBS. She had Humana. She said, ""I don't want Humana."" She has no recollection of talking with or communicating with Humana! They say they have her electronic signature. She does not own a computer and could not even log on or turn it on if she did!",1,Humana
70,"When I moved to Ohio in September of 2017 I had to change my Humana plan. The sales person on the phone asked if I was a veteran. She explained that the plan for veterans was better for me than the plan I had before my move. She asked if I had dentures and explained that because I did the plan offered ""a free denture reline once a year. Towards the end of 2018 I decided to take advantage of this option. Upon giving the dental office my Humana card they provided me with an estimate due to my coverage that showed that everything was covered completely. AFTER the reline I got a bill from Humana showing my ""free"" denture reline was only going to cost me $350.00. In the fine print that was not explained in any way it states that ""a free denture reline is exactly ""a"" one plate, not upper and lower. They were also considerate enough to pay for the cheaper of the two plates.",1,Humana
71,"I am a type 1 Brittle Diabetic. My prior insurance company, which was also a Medicare plan, approved my insulin and pump. At the first of the year I switched to Humana. First off they denied my insulin, a prior authorization was done and it was denied again. Then they denied my pump supplies. At this point not only was my doctor's office working on this, so was I. I am going on almost 3 months now with NO INSULIN! If it wasn't for My endocrinologist and her office supplying me with samples, I would be dead. ",1,Humana
72,I've been with Humana 8 years and never had 1 problem until now. I order all 5 of my meds 90 day mail order.

Transferred, gave all info and that person said she couldn't do it, that I had a different group plan so she would have to transfer me. Waited again... on phone 23 min, got disconnected. They had my number in case disconnected, but didn't call back. Got on line to try to change Dr. info. ""Chatted"" typed, with rep. after typing for another 20 min, she said she had to transfer me. I told her my Dr. information and asked her to contact whatever Dept needed it, that I was finished after being on phone and computer for 45 min.

Finally after 2 months someone saw their lack of paying attention to detail. So my coverage is good. Now to get my money back, I as a disabled person am told I have to got to the different pharmacies to collect paperwork. How about I break both your legs and demand you make it through a Marine Corps Recruit Depot to get your money and life back? Kind of hard. Humana lacks the Human in their Fake Name.",1,Humana
79,My husband and I just moved to Florida six months ago and were told by a broker that Humana is a popular insurance in our area. We are meeting with someone this morning about changing to a different company. We should have read the reviews before committing to Humana.

These people act like they care about you when you speak to them on the phone, but their actions prove they wish to deny claims and requests at all costs no matter how much it hurts the health of the patient. I have canceled this plan for a new plan starting in February.",1,Humana

They also give out inaccurate information. They'll tell me something is covered, and then I found out later that it isn't... Leading to hundreds of dollars in bills that I shouldn't have had to pay. I needed to have surgery but I was afraid to do it while I was on Humana because everything they tell me about coverage is incorrect.

Went to the ER to find out that fractured all the bones on the outside of my foot. They told me to see an orthopedic surgeon within 2-3 days. I saw my primary doctor that Monday. He did an urgent referral to an orthopedic surgeon. That Wednesday my referral was denied because Humana said I had changed primary doctors. Which I had not! So I contacted Humana and got that squared away. My doctor put in another urgent referral. It took a week for the authorization. I was told which orthopedic surgeon to contact.

I have been seeing him, however, received a call today from the Medical Group stating Humana would not cover since Humana states he is not listed as my PCP.

90,"To begin with, I think it is ludicrous and suspicious that a major health insurance company does not allow messaging through one's online customer account. I can only conjecture that they don't want to record anything in writing in order to be accountable to the subscriber. Therefore, a subscriber is doomed to call customer service and get people who appear to be untrained and unknowledgeable and can't transfer a call correctly. When I have to spell the word endoscopy or explain renal ultrasound, that's a big clue that customer service is lacking in credentials.

Customer service said they would look into this, and correct the problem. After about a month, she went to receive a flu shot again along with me. Not approved, the pharmacy said she had another plan. This time I called, at this point I was upset.

The first claim was denied, they've been given different reasons as to why. Depending on who answers I called repeatedly with no satisfaction. Now there are 3 claims submitted and pending from my provider because they kept claiming that they didn't receive them, which now I know they have and I need to wait a week or 2 to see if they're going to pay it.

And example: I use the ** to treat a knee surgery. It’s a generic drug that I paid about five dollars a tube when I was with Blue Cross Medicare. Humana would not let me get the ** and was forcing me to buy the name brand $50 a tube. My pharmacy and my doctor appealed that decision and Humana came back with $45 per tube. I have found that Humana rejects almost everything the first time it’s submitted. ,2,Humana

It to extend her life a little longer but Humana has denied that because the end result will still be the same. So they don't want to spend any money putting her to rehab because she still going to die in the end and I think that's pretty crappy. So they denied her paying for the rehab through the hospital which might have made it possible for her to walk and stay in her home a little longer before the end of her life. I don't think they should have the right to deny her rehab when it could help even though the end result will be the same.

I am just very grateful I could get out of this policy in the timeframe allowed and go back to regular Medicare and Plan F Medigap BCBS. First of all their doctor lists and customer service reps are useless. Dr. lists are TOTALLY useless and inaccurate. Customer service reps. are useless and give out wrong info. Long approval waits for essential services. I was told I needed a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound when they found a mass in my right breast. ",1,Humana
201,"The representative lied about some coverage. Calling Humana customer service was riding a huge ferris wheel. No one seemed to know answers to my questions. I was ""always"" forwarded to so many departments and then back to where I started. Felt they were all in the same room and just referring me to one another. Didn't seem to be much training going on.",4,Humana
202,"They actually cause so much anxiety and stress in my life. They barely pay their bills, never on-time, deny services that would improve your health. Change providers and benefits at will. Some physicians don't even want to accept Humana. Next year Medicare and new supplement. Lesson learned.",1,Humana
203,"First, Humana lied to me before I even signed up. While reviewing plans, I phoned and spoke to a representative, directly, specifically asking if one of my service providers was part of the plan's network. After a few minutes on hold, the rep came back and said ""yes, don't worry, your transition will be seamless..."" Don't need to be The Great Kreskin to know what happened when I tried to update my insurance with that provider. Next, review their drug formulary with a magnifying glass.

208,"Humana is the quintessential example of how all health insurance companies in America are stealing us blind, and why the USA consistently ranks among the worse offenders regarding the health care of its own citizens. I am 69 years old and retired, living primarily on my $857 Social Security check. When I applied for extra help from Medicare to help pay for my mounting drug bills, I was TURNED DOWN. I'm apparently making too much money.

I went to pay it and they tell me I don't have a policy that it was canceled on January 25/18. I never received a letter or anything letting me know they canceled. But they did take my money. So I should get a refund. Not so easy. They place you on hold for long amounts of time and are doing all they can Not to refund my money. I don't know about you but I don't just have money to toss away. So I want my refund and to warn others about my battle with Humana.,1,Humana

It put a bit of a pinch on our finances, but we paid it, as the salesmen made it clear this needed to be done before open enrollment ended. ",1,Humana
212,"I last had Healthspring and it seems to have been a better buy than Humana because it had better overall services. There seemed to be more helpful information as part of their program and they had a better customer service set up. It was quicker and easier to reach their offices, ask questions, and get answers. Most calls to Humana result in a robot telling me that the humans are busy with other calls and I can do better calling back on a Tuesday after 4 pm. I have called back after 4 pm and been told that they are closed and to call back the next day. When I finally reach them it's a general customer service rep who seems to flip a coin as to which ""specialist"" she wants to send me to. While holding for the specialist I get hung up on and have to start all over again. It's very time consuming.",3,Humana

Anyone reading this DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT SWITCH TO HUMANA. Voted worst insurance company in the world. They should be shut down for the worst company in the world.

At the time... No problem because they were In-Network. However, when I contacted HUMANA to ask about this unknown doctor, they INSISTED I needed to answer several questions to CHANGE my PCP. They TOTALLY ignored my question, as if they did not bother reading it, and refused to acknowledge this was THEIR error and not a change but a correction. Additionally, I sent them a list of all the healthcare providers at this health center and they ignored it.

They want premiums paid on time and market you to 'use their online website to easily' do so. If premiums are not paid on time they immediately start sending mail notices (along with junk mail wanting you to buy other products they endorse/offer). We have been making online premiums for years... and no one can fix their system this month (1/2018) it would seem. When you call to report it is broken, all they want to do is shift you to 5 different departments and no one knows anything about it. I think they should quit sending out nonsense mail offerings, and other unnecessary junk mail and fix their website, which is now worse than ever. Better yet, take more time providing payment for the ill patients' needs, which doesn't get done very well either it seems. Does anyone else see this?",1,Humana

Long Version: I went in for the first time since starting my coverage to set up my Primary Care Provider (PCP). Afterwards, she had referred me over to other services, since my plan requires referrals for those services. After calling Humana to ensure coverage, since they still had not updated my PCP, I was informed my PCP is not in-network.

When contacted by pissed customer for more information I replied and they haven't contacted me back. My US Senator called and I informed him of the ripoff and they are looking into ways to curb this company for failures to honor their contract.

They are incredibly disrespectful of my time and as a customer, I expect better. If they have some sort of ""announcement"" to make, they will not stop calling you until you talk to them.

Despite positive results from the care provided we refunded the payment then have had to spend multiple hours re-documenting using the terminology they required in order to TRY to recover the payment for those services.

258,Switched to Humana for 2016. Dropped them for 2017. It took the place of my Medicare and secondary insurance. They said it would be easier but it was not. Some of my medical providers would not accept it and DID NOT want to get on it. In fact one of my providers got upset because the Humana office that called to see if they would start accepting their insurance got pretty pushy with them.,1,Humana
259,"Humana never told my 81 year old mother that they would drop her insurance if she moved to another state. Her doctors in the new state didn't know this either. So she ended up with almost a 2000 dollar medical bill that Humana refused to pay. She has now been in the nursing home since 8/26 to receive physical therapy for a broken leg. The new state's Humana still has not approved her therapy. It's been 10 days. Humana is not only crooked, but they also cause harm to their customers. I will drop them for my mother as soon as open enrollment happens.",1,Humana
260,"Deny, deny, deny. For the last year and a half I have had to deal with Humana's incompetence in handling and getting claims paid. They had me listed in the wrong state (LA--listed as New Orleans, LA--is not Vegas people, read the entire address!). They claimed the codes were changed--they were the same codes they approved within the same coverage year. You must have ordered something extra--nope, didn't. I chased all this idiocy for more than a year. They have the power (they think) to keep stringing you along till the end of time. They bounce you from one rep to the other, they don't care if you get cut off, or they have sent you to the wrong department. They think you will give up--DON'T.",2,Humana
261,"Humana's customer service is horrible. In order to get results to requests they have to be done through Facebook to get their attention and even I had to file a complaint to the Attorney 's office. It took more than 60 days for Humana to assume responsibility for the payment of a rendered service. Even though that Humana advertise services nationwide, they do not have any providers in the Keys so they had to pay for the services because it was not up to me as a subscriber to pay for the bill if they don’t have the providers available in the area.",3,Humana
262,"Medicare covers most of my medical bills. Humana is my secondary insurance as well my husband's, which he wants me to use, but it doesn't cover the bill as well as my old insurance did.",4,Humana
263,Humana has been a very good health insurance. I have been with them for a long time and have never had any problems. I would recommend them to anyone.,5,Humana
264,"In April I had severe neck and shoulder pain. Had gone to my MD and in and out of Urgent Care. I called HUMANA nurse advice line and was told by HUMANA RN to go to ER for further treatment. I would NEVER go to any ER without calling my insurance company and getting an OK. I went that day and HUMANA is now refusing to pay $800.00 charge because they did NOT think it was an emergency. Took me 3 weeks and numerous phone calls to everyone I could to get a copy of that conversation. Finally when I received it, guess what? They erased the last half of the tape to cover their butts. How convenient for them huh? This is NOT an honest practice and you really have to be careful. ",1,Humana
265,"Moved from Florida to Las Vegas -- so knew I would need a new primary care doctor. Called Humana to change my address - and get instructions on how to get list of approved providers on the Internet site. Found listing of approved providers --- and started going thru ones listed as accepting new patients. The first 5 I called said they are NOT ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS... contrary to information shown on web site. Eventually I found several that were accepting new patients, but wait times ranged from 7 weeks to 6 months before appointment could be scheduled. Finally forced to chose Doctor from Iran, who was trained in Ecuador. Can't wait to find out what he is like... but he was the only Doctor available. ",1,Humana
266,This company is a scam as I bought Humana one dental and now I need a root canal and was told that they do not cover that but on their website they say they do. So I will be reporting them to the state insurance commission asap. And I will be ending my dental plan asap. And just a heads up they will continue to take money out of your account if you put them on autopay as I did but I will get a new debit card before the end of the month. Also I will let every one I know not to do business with this sorry company.,1,Humana
267,"I'm so dissatisfied with this company that it bring me to tears when I have a doctor visit. Because I'm not sure if they are going to pay my bills or not, sad I'm in the doctor office and they call me to the desk and said we can't wait on you because your bill was not paid through Humana and they said you have a primary inc. Which I don't. So got to leave until it's straighten out and pay the bill. I call and tell me I'm not enrolled with them and I've had a card since 2016. Finally I'm transferred to someone else and they fine me in the system. This was May! Bill is not paid, my understanding my co-pay is a 186 dollars and I've met that. But I go too the hospital for a medical problems and I can't it's a 300 dollar deductible!!! How? I pay a hundred and twenty five dollars a month! What for? I have never been so dissatisfied in my life! If I had that type of money what the purpose! I would not recommend them to any one! If I could I would take that one star back.",1,Humana

However, they are still listed as accepting our insurance on both the Humana website and the Humana representatives on the phone claim they do as well.",1,Humana
269,"I am considering changing back to Anthem this October because of the need for a referral for every doctor you need to see. Even the doctors offices find it excessive. Everyone I tell that I have to get a referral before I can see a doctor thinks it is a bad practice. My feet hurt very badly for a week, I finally decided that I needed to see someone. So I called the doctors office and got an appointment quickly but oh wait ""you need a referral."" So I called my Physician, ""please try to hurry and get me a referral so I can see this doctor, my feet hurt badly."" I don't like to go to doctors and won't go unless I need to, so I don't just make appointments needlessly.",2,Humana
270,"There was an error made by Medicare who wrongly suspended my coverage. They quickly admitted the error and reinstated my coverage. BUT THAT DID NOT MATTER TO HUMANA!!! Without any explanation, they refused to admit my coverage without explanation. I am a licensed attorney in California. When I asked Humana for their office that would deal with the legal consequences of their negligence, they had nobody in California. They referred me to a South Carolina office that was closed. If you do business in California you must have an ""agent for the service of process"" in California. They illegally refused to provide this information. The Secretary of State should cancel their license to operate in this state but that office is also totally incompetent!",1,Humana
271,"Humana is definitely just another business. My experience with their business from signing up for my son to finding some doctors that accept this insurance this mess. Everything is a fight. This wound vac is horrible. Constant problems, a total nightmare and I can't believe this is allowed. The wound vac is creating more problems it's total garbage. If you can get KCI wound vac do it. It actually works good. Humana legally cheating their paying clients and gets away with it. ",1,Humana
272,"Rather than paying $320 dollars for a mistake they made (all is documented), the workers at Humana Medicare have used various techniques to discourage me from holding them accountable. Here is the list: left me on hold for 40 minutes - then transferred me where I was on hold another 20 minutes, given me an incorrect address for the grievance and appeals department, transferred me to a wrong number- transferred me to another wrong number - and another wrong number and another and another all in one call, had multiple oral and written errors in each and every communication, which became the focal point rather than paying the bill, disregarded my grievance which was based on updating my benefits for the new year (the rule) and receiving incorrect information which I did not know until I had already acted on the given information only to find out the customer-service representative didn't know what she was talking about.

I have to have lab work done 2-3 times a year. My doc is very conservative and does not overdo it. I am on two meds for BP and trying to get off these. I am low cost to this company. However I must have labs. Never have I had a copay for labs until recently. I paid. Then on my next trip to the lab, I was quoted $189.00 that I ""may have to pay"" in addition to my copay! What's up? I cancelled my appointment and came home to call Humana. Not!! Is their 1-800 number out of service? I have tried calling for 2 days at different times of the day and I get a fast busy.

We paid over 2000 dollars monthly until Obamacare brought it down drastically. I still paid a lot out of pocket and I'm not sickly. But last year my husband had a too high red count, was sent to a oncologist only to find out it was his red rice supplement causing it and a month later I had to get blood transfusion sent to an oncologist only to find out I was anemic. I take an iron pill daily. Suddenly I was told Georgia was not carrying Humana anymore. Liar liar it does. Several family members have it. So does many businesses. I was told by a lawyer they have violated my rights because I had the highest bracket they carried. I paid the most out of pocket and the first four payments would have paid the bills the paid.

I have been on the same eye drop since January and I have been paying for it. Now that I have met my deductible, they decided I don't need it! They cash the checks for my premiums with no problem. My employer pays almost 6000 a year for my coverage with a 2500 deductible. Now they won't approve my drops because it's their turn to pay! Horrible!

She now faces eviction and is going to lose her car, her only source of transportation, why? Because she has been waiting for her insurance money from them for nearly 3 months. She has complied with them when they say they need something, her doctor has even called them and still nothing.

That's money we will never have, and then MAYBE they will sell him another plan!! Again, never notified of this fact. My husband's medication is to help with his insomnia, and now he can't get it.

They have to split the new patients up between the other Drs. My Dr. even called Humana and told them he would take me as a patient but Humana said no. This is taking away patients from my Dr. and giving them to a Dr. people have never seen before.

So few, that the list also contains doctors in suburbs and Indiana because there's about 8 cardiologist in the city I can see and they all except for one, have horrible ratings on the internet. The one that has a good rating didn't want to take me as a new patient because he no longer wants to deal with Unified. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this insurance. I have BCBSIL, Blue Focus Care, Unified Physicians Network. The worst.",1,BCBS Illinois
18,"Extremely expensive dental plan. Only covers 50% of all dental services. Only covers 2 cleanings/year, 100%, IF you go to an in network dentist. If not, they cover less than 40%. Blue Cross of Illinois also has a limit of $1,000.00 benefits per year. Just think that a simple crown nowadays is about $940.00 per occurrence, if you need two done you are fried. Then you have to pay one full year or premiums before you can qualify for any major service. This insurance is worthless. Do not fall for it. I had to switch to Physicians Mutual Insurance dental plan.",2,BCBS Illinois
19,"A company so bad it received an ""F"" rating from the Better Business Bureau. If your company contracts with them for your health care, you might want to switch companies. But then, all American health care is rotten due to the cozy relationship our government maintains with insurance companies. So, if you're young, you might want to immigrate to a country with better healthcare (which is pretty much all other western countries). Good luck.",1,BCBS Illinois
20,"If I could give a negative 10 I would. Wife has severe injuries to both feet that required an MRI as ordered by her specialist. BCBS denied the test 3 times and it took 4+ months to get the approval. They have unqualified morons that pretend to be doctors and put the patient's health in jeopardy. Finally had the MRI done after repeated arguments by her doctor with BCBS. The MRI shows that she has tears in tissue of the main tendon. She now has a cast on one foot for 4-6 weeks and if not healed, then removal of tissue of another tendon from somewhere else in her body. Then repeat the same on the other foot!!!",1,BCBS Illinois
21,"Total Nightmare trying to get anyone to help me at BCBSIL over the phone. I talked to one agent with heavy foreign accent and asked him about HSA's. He didn't even know what an HSA was and was googling it while on the phone with me! Seriously! He told me he was googling it. Days later, and 2 hours on a phone with a ""customer advocate"" to find out why my wife's PET scan isn't medically covered, when the policy book they sent me says it is. Forget it. The phone operators reach intellectual dead ends, don't know what I am asking, do not understand anything related to health insurance in the USA, won't talk anymore if you keep asking them questions, and then hours later, with my BP through the roof, I was dumped into a disconnect dial tone.

22,"Their online system doesn't retain information. Log into your account and check your ""My Documents"" and nothing is there... Imagine that! Looking at previous billing history is non-existent and I only canceled my account 2 months ago. Then, when you talk to someone, they refer you to the Health Insurance Marketplace because they're lazy... Then they gouge you on the fees. Navigating through their pamphlets and brochures, coverage plans and plan brochures is like reading an alien language. Their billing system is completely backwards and generally not up to date.",1,BCBS Illinois
23,"I am on IL Medicaid; & also am required to choose a community healthcare plan. I was on Meridian Healthcare Plan; & using the local Comm. Health Clinic as my primary care provider. This was fine; but was hoping to get a 'real' private Dr. as my care provider. So when open enrollment came around this 2018; I got a letter in the mail from IL State saying they have more options to choose from for required insurance. So; I chose Blue Cross/Blue Shield, & it stated that a well-known local Dr. does take the plan. ",1,BCBS Illinois
24,I have not been on my medication for 6 days while Blue Cross of Illinois denies my prescription. When I was online at healthcare.gov picking a plan for 2018 the healthcare said the medicine is part of my plan.

25,"I called BCBS IL this morning and was on hold for a very unreasonable amount of time. When I finally spoke with customer service, I could not understand her and asked if I could speak to a supervisor. She could not understand me and I could not understand her. We finally got disconnected and I thought surely she will call me back and she never did. So I called back again and the same thing happened. I called back a third time and asked to speak to someone in customer service and they wound up connecting me with somebody in the marketplace that wasn't even affiliated with Blue Cross Blue Shield. I was dumbfounded. The guy I spoke with said this has happened many times. He was from the United States and he worked for the marketplace for Obamacare. ",1,BCBS Illinois
26,The absolute worst. Foreign cust service. Can't understand the long wait times and frequent premium increases. Obama you really screwed up health care in this country and BCBS of Illinois is taking full advantage.,1,BCBS Illinois
27,"VERY POOR customer service. I have not been able to get my explanation of benefits for this whole year. BC/BS tells me that I have to get them from the doctor but the doctor's office says, no BC/BS should be providing me with them. I have repeatedly called, been transferred all over, disconnected (even though they ask for a call back number, which they never call you back on). The doctor's office suggested I call and ask to speak to a supervisor. I did that but they won't let you speak to a supervisor until you explain what the problem is. Even after you explain they would not connect you to a supervisor. I was kept on hold twice for over 45 minutes and then without coming back on the line to explain anything they transferred me to my doctor's office. They are rude, and terrible. Maybe if we had more choices for health insurance they would be a little nicer. They only care about getting your outrageously expensive premium. They don't care about people at all!",1,BCBS Illinois
28,"I had private BCBS of IL. I was livid because I had a test done for asthma and it sent them a trigger that pulled my old medical charts. There were things that were wrong in my chart. I fought the appeal and won. So I thought it would go back and pay the bills that they stopped payment on till I won. Which by the way was over $15,000. They said they would only pay them if I reinstated my insurance since they had already cancelled my policy... Ready for this I had three days to come up with $1200. There was no way. So it stayed cancelled and now I have huge medical debt. I feel ripped off that I paid these people money for months and for what? They didn't pay for anything. My friend who worked there told me they are told to deny then process. BCBS of Illinois is a joke and rob from people.",1,BCBS Illinois

That has also not arrived.",1,BCBS Illinois

I had a similar issue last year started in Nov 2016 and resolved in April 2017 making 100 of calls. Every time a new story. Same thing happened to me again. My wife and I had a different policies. There was a addition for newborn in family on July. As per them there is a sixty days period to add a newborn in the plan and for the first 30 days baby should be covered by Mother's insurance.,1,BCBS Illinois
31,"I pay $1,000/month for this garbage 'insurance'. They'll allow you to see a primary care doc, ok, but if, God forbid, you have to see a specialist? Forget it. You're screwed. That means no oncologist if you have cancer, no physical therapist if you have an injury, no dermatologist if you have so much as a wart. It's the most God awful system ever devised. Literally, I pray for you if you have this insurance, because God knows, you won't be getting the help that you need. Oh, and when you ask why the hell this is happening? They'll say, well, it's cause you're poor and have state insurance (even though you're fully aware the 'state' has NOTHING to do with it). WTF?",1,BCBS Illinois
32,"I am the office manager for a chiropractic office and find it very frustrating I can never get through to talk to anybody. I have claim questions for multiple patients and I sit on hold over 45 minutes. Actually probably longer because I always have to hang up. I've spent countless hours on hold. You would think someone would pick up within 5 minutes considering you have to jump through hoops to even get patched through to someone. There are always ""high call volumes"" no matter what time of day you call. Someone actually answered last week just to tell me to call back later... super frustrating. There are patients who put off care until their questions are answered and your company makes that very very hard.",1,BCBS Illinois
33,"I had an appointment with a eye specialist in December 2016. He had to refer me to an eye retina specialist, but he warned me that Blue Cross Blue Precision Silver was dropping out of the Market Place and they were not informing any of their customers. He advised me to wait until after the first of the year and when I'm on a new carrier then follow-up with my retina appointment otherwise I might get stuck with an unpaid bill. Well he was right about the unpaid bill. Blue Cross kept playing around with my bill from the eye specialist and after six months it is still unpaid and now they are nowhere to be found. I've spent hours calling one number only to be told to call a different one. I'd forward the bill to them and it would come back saying wrong office.

35,"False Statements and bad customer service - When you get your insurance statement of services, be aware that the insurance portion of the billing - The so-called reimbursement to the provider is 100% false. In most cases, for smaller services like chiropractic care, there is no reimbursement at all! It's just price fixing and way for you to think you received a benefit. Or, in a best case, a small portion of the number posted was sent to the provider. There is no such thing as insurance anymore - Only managed service contracts that are essentially marketing tools to push patients to providers accepting the bad terms of the insurance company to bring in patients that believe it will be financially good for them. You are much better off paying cash prices which will be less than your out of pocket with insurance! Most providers take cash, especially those trying to build a practice.",1,BCBS Illinois

Due to the retroactive approval, I was being forced to take Medicare, as the SSDI was covered for more than two years.

Not taking into account the painful discogram I went through that showed two large tears in the discs. Able to get my MD to go peer to peer and still lost. Now I am out of a job, paid a HUGE COBRA payment so there would be no lapse in coverage for this and they deny me at the last minute.

The reason of my phone call was to have an answer why they charge me $289.94 on January 3 and $212.88 then they charge me again $154.95 on January 9. The agent appointed is neglecting me because he does not remember conversations involved during the process. As far as I know BBS is neglecting customers because of the horrible customer service they have. Besides that it is impossible to register online if you do not have an ID#.

Fine with us, as long as our basic preventive services were covered. Our physicians have always accepted BCBS PPOs, and we were informed by BCBS that the Blue Choice PPO was comparable to our last plan. Great.

I handed my insurance card to the lady at the front desk who quickly handed it back and said ""we don't take this insurance"" I then asked who does and she laughed and stated ""no one!"" I paid out of pocket for the Dr. Appointment which was $100.00 and then got a bill for $420.00 for the lab work! I understand being ""out of network"" and paying more! But the whole point of having a PPO is so you can go wherever you want! I also received an order to get a mammogram done. I left that appointment so upset that I was given a script for an antidepressant. I came home called the number on my insurance card and was given the name of a facility that does take my insurance. I made an appointment with that facility because I had to get a new mammogram order from someone in my network to prevent having to pay out of pocket $500.00 or more for this mammogram.",1,BCBS Illinois

Blue Cross Blue Shield took my premium and money from March, 2014 to August 2014 and did not cover one penny of my medical costs causing me financial damage and emotional pain. Someone dropped the ball and REMOVED me from their system, this caused me to not be covered when I thought I was. It is too long of a story to write in here. It is just very upsetting--thanks to ""Obama don't care.""",1,BCBS Illinois

We called again the next week or so to make sure that the refund was being processed and it was for both months Jan and Feb. We were assured that it was for both months and were told to wait. We called again a couple of weeks ago to check the status of the refund and were told that it's being processed and if we don't get our refund check by Feb 20th to call again. Well I called today, Feb 19th as I didn't want to wait one extra day as I had a feeling the check didn't come so it's probably not coming. ",1,BCBS Illinois
73,"I was sold an health insurance by Blue Cross & Blueshield hmo pos. I switched to this one due to 2 reasons 1. Doctors and Hospitals are close by, 2. I spend winter time with my daughter in Fl. BB told me before I go to FL, they will assign a PCP in FL so that I would have the same coverage as I have in Illinois. It was a total lie to get you enrolled. When I called BBC, they said there is no such thing. If any one else has the same issues, I think this is good for a class action law suit. ",1,BCBS Illinois
74,"My doctor ordered a test. The hospital administered the test just as has happened for years. Not anymore! BCBS denied it stating ""Member did not meet BCBS Medical Policy Criteria for Coverage"". I have to ask why would I know the criteria better than the doctor or the hospital at which the group health insurance plan is through. If I was a doctor or worked for BCBS maybe I would know but that did not seem to work for my doctors. So we got hit with an $1,800+ bill for something that should have been less than $200.

I am shocked at how poor the customer service is. Last time I was given incorrect information about a provider being in Network, then actually went there to find out they were not - that was after an hour phone call!! I signed up for this plan BECAUSE hospitals close to me and my Drs. were in Network, only to find out after open enrollment that they were no longer in network. ",1,BCBS Illinois

They will only pay to rent it for 3 months first and then they will pay for the machine if my deductible has been met. By then my deductible will have not been met as it starts over in 1 week. This blows and is so unfair. I called them but they just said that was their policy. I asked them could they waive the 3 months of renting the machine first if my doctor sent them a letter stating that I had no problems with the machine during my sleep study and they said no. In other words I'm screwed and will end up having to buy the machine.,1,BCBS Illinois

Very rude customer service, dishonest and unethical insurance company. I had only had one claim with them in the 10 years and they applied it all to my deductible!!!!!

Given that an infection is more likely at the beginning days after any surgery, three days are too long. Yet within few hours they called me to deny my medications. Now I will have to pay out of my pocket $150 money that I do not have. And insurance companies complain when we call for public healthcare?!!! United Healthcare since its inception made a mockery of our healthcare. I will cancel that plan.

In the meantime, it looks like I have no insurance coverage since 1/31/19. Very problematic should I need medical care during UHC's incompetent administrative screw up.

It was held up because one of my medicines were not covered (which it was by Cigna...) so the prescription was delayed! I then ran out of my medicine while waiting for the new mail order to be sent. I asked my doctor for a 7 day prescription to carry me through until mail order arrived. Lo and behold my surprise when picking it up at pharmacy, I had to pay full price!

We asked about each of our doctors being in the network and one by one they said all doctors were in the network. This was a lie because my wife's pain management doctor was not and is not in the network. Now we are hung with a $700 pain management procedure from January 17th. They said if we did not like the new plan we could ""revert"" back to the old plan before January 31st. This was also a lie. Now she has to reapply for coverage and it must be done before March 15th or she loses all coverage. We are still waiting on the application forms.

Since I had been treated within the last 6 month for GERD they refuse to pay for the visit or routine bloodwork and urine test. I was not being seen for GERD, however they refuse the believe that. I have been fighting this for months. I am guessing that since I had a chicken pox as a kid they would not pay for a rash either. My advice to you is to look further.

158,"As a seasoned mental health provider, I am disgusted with the poor coverage and the inadequate care for the insured people. The reimbursement rates are extremely low (60% of most insurance plans), so generally only new or desperate providers are willing to participate.

I strongly recommended against this insurer if you require mental health coverage.",1,United Health Care

UHC did not require pre authorization for the procedure so I went ahead and had it done. After all bills were filed UHC paid some but not others. When I contacted them to find out why they declined the coverage but kept changing the reason why. One year later they claim it was medically unnecessary. The supervisor at Mayo has been great but to no avail. They are trying to stick me with $21,000.00. Why? I switched to new insurance in December 2017 just after procedure when I was offered a new position with a new company. I am no longer with UHC but I was covered through the end of the year 2017.

Went to CVS and spoke to Pharmacist, and explained the situation, her response was CVS got paid from United Healthcare. I can remove United Heath from the system for future prescriptions. I ask how does that correct this issue? She said that ""the Pharmacist of record will call you tomorrow."" I don't know how that is going to rectify this issue.

I was also very concerned about doing additional knee damage without the guidance of diagnostics. After 8 weeks, multiple phone calls, and a steroid injection, I'm still limping around, trying to keep working, taking meds to get me through each 12 hour shift, not knowing what the cause is.

She continues to see her doctors until they would not see her because of insurance the sales rep. Was holding the paperwork back because she did qualify for that service. When bills start coming late charges and all. She couldn't at and could understand what was happening. I got involved. He needed her to get the dental asap and to call when teeth was completed.

Saturday one, Monday another, they just won't stop... Guess they love killing trees and making California paper, envelops, and someone pays for the postage (you and I in the premiums). Did anyone audit this crap out of California, I'd fire about 50% of UHC employees, last year I bought a CPAP they didn't cover, I finally agreed no pay but they wrote me for 9 months about it!

This disease is progressive and there is no cure. It affects his heart and will shorten his life.

Specifically, they pay 30-35% the going cash pay rate in California. $60 per session (most therapists get $150 per session). Also, they refuse to pay the industry standard one hour session (90837), only agreeing to the 90834, or 35-45 min session, which is not what happens. Imagine if you only saw all clients for half hour sessions, and then told them it is all their insurance would allow. Clients often wonder why it is hard to find a therapist under their insurance, that is because they cannot keep the lights on if they took only insurance cases from companies like United.

I was told they would only cover 18 tablets for a 90 day period. This is a daily medication! I was told that it's so ridiculously expensive this is why it's often not covered. Perhaps you could stop showing your repetitive commercials that we see every single day and night constantly. Instead you could actually lower the cost of this medication so that people can actually use it!!!,1,United Health Care
457,"I have sleep apnea my entire life and recently attempted to seek treatment to prolong my life. My father died as from complications related to sleep apnea. I was scheduled for an overnight sleep study with my doctor, but United Health Care denied it at the last minute and instead I was given a take home test to perform at home. This was frustrating, but I went ahead with it. I was diagnosed with moderately severe sleep apnea and did 30 days with an APAP machine. My doctor then told me we need to do a ""titration"" overnight at the office to dial the machine in so it would work better for me as I was swallowing air and waking up due to the pressure being to high.

458,"I just became under United. Well let me put it this way. My approval will start August 1st. Of course I can't log in. The coverage is idiotic. No eyeglasses. No Chiropractor. They give you absolutely nothing and my payment to the rheumatoid doctor is higher. Primary is higher at this stage of the game. I have no choice The coverage that I have. Now their Rheumatoid doctor in my area ""I'm not accepting new patients."" I have to drive 20 miles away that's where I have to drive and I was willing. Unfortunately they're taking no more new patients so I'm stuck with United. Well speaking to a rep at United he wouldn't even allow me to go on this site and pick out my primary doctor. He picked it up and said ""you can always change it."" No kidding. I will hold on to this coverage until my other insurance coverage adds more Drs.",2,United Health Care

460,"In March I had a scheduled surgery on my shoulder. My doctor submitted all of the necessary pre-surgical forms to United and it was a covered procedure. When my surgeon actually opened the area up he determined that a similar, but different procedure would be more successful in resolving my shoulder injury. This was also a covered procedure, although not the procedure we had initially anticipated. I paid my deductible and surgical fees prior to the surgery. United has denied the procedure because my surgeon determined the alternate procedure would provide better results. This denial resulted in my payment of the deductible being negated and United charging my deductible again as they did not honor the first deductible.",1,United Health Care

463,I was forced into this insurance when my company changed providers. I needed to order some prescription meds. I received a call from the pharmacy stating the order had been red flagged by United. The pharmacy received a call stating they would need the doctor to rewrite the script detailing how much I needed to take each day and when. This is insulin and the script was written PRN. ,1,United Health Care

They now say this is a tier 2 hospital and will only pay as such. Please know these people are rude, unknowledgeable from person to person, would not pull my phone calls with reps, and even though I told them I looked online and provided a pic of online information stating tier 1, and the CSR phone call refs. #, they still say I am wrong.

470,Never had this insurance. Cancelled it the same day. That was 4 months ago. Looking in bank account found that this company has taken money for something we NEVER received. The nasty SAMANTHA customer service rep LIED about sending us a refund. Oh we did get a booklet on 6.20.2017 explaining our benefits for something we never asked for nor used. Didn't know we even had it until we looked at the bank account and found 4 withdrawals and lovely SAMANTHA said she could only refund 1 month. Are you kidding.

471,I have been using an out of network provider for care and submitting claims for the allotted portion of reimbursements. This has been going on for approximately two years now. There was suddenly something wrong with my submissions even though nothing had changed with the service or submissions. I would correct claim form and resubmit. It would be denied with a new reason. I would correct and resubmit. Each time I was careful to follow instructions from UHC rep to the letter and mail it to the address for claims ON MY UHC healthcare card. The last thing I received from UHC was a notice that I had not submitted the corrected claim on time and that I would need to appeal for any hope of reimbursement. The notice (EOB) came from the address on my health card card and stated that I needed to submit letter of appeal within 180 days. I called UHC once again to find out. WTH!!! By this time I am pretty steamed. ,1,United Health Care

I try to always get generic, but every thing doesn't come in generic. I actually purchase my scripts via Blink and other discount pharmacies paying their price, it's cheaper than you copay thru UHC. I'm paying for insurance I can't even use. They don't care about your health. It's all about greed! Horrible insurance. Can't wait until I can change. Trying to get a new doctor is impossible, and you better hope you never need a CT!",1,United Health Care
473,I was kind of shocked to see thousands of complaints much like my own about United Health Care. Thank God our company decided to switch carriers after 3 months. Too many people in our small company including myself with so many complaints. I had been on a particular pain med for about 3 years and United Health Care decides they will not cover it and there is no generic form because it’s an extended release. I found out a month or two ahead of time that it wouldn't be covered so I tried to be proactive and not liking walking into a wall that I didn't know was there. It didn't matter.,1,United Health Care

Upon returning to doctor for results, it was recommended that I have a bone scan, and or PET scan. However they have denied me once again. It's a shame that they are allowed to play with people's lives in such a careless way. I'm beside myself with worry, wondering if I might have cancer somewhere else, and yet this so called insurance company doesn't even care.

Right after I selected my plan for 2017 and was locked in, UnitedHealthcare informed me the medication I have been taking for years for a long-term health issue will no longer be covered. They offered alternatives (which made no sense, because the alternatives were more expensive than the original drug).

I have witnessed this numerous times with numerous patients over the past 3 months. It is very difficult for the patient to get this updated short of having a old work comp carrier or auto carrier call BCBS to update. The hoops that BCBS makes patients and providers jump through is ridiculous.

39,"I had Florida Blue with my job. After leaving my job was offered cobra, my deductible of 5000 was paid. After being assured if I took the cobra my plan just carriers on and deductible was paid after paying 513.24 month I got EOB telling my deductible is not paid. They went back to see how much of the 5000 was from me and put 2500 deductible on me because my wife did not stay on plan. There was no notification of this change along with being told everything stays as is. This is very deceitful. I am a veteran and kept the insurance because deductible was paid for the year. I could of went to VA free if I was not lied to. Now I have paid 513.24 a month and have to pay my doctor bills on top of it. I could understand if my plan was a $2500 per person but it was not. It was $5000 before a dollar was paid for any bills between my wife and I.",1,BCBS Florida
40,Let me start by saying I work in the insurance industry. So generally I would like to think I know what I am doing to get my claims handled. I have had FL BCBS as my primary insurance since September of 2016. Recently in the last two months they started denying my claims on the basis that I have other insurance and they aren't my primary payer. This is absolutely RIDICULOUS. I thought a simple call to let them know this would fix the issue. But two months later and I am still fighting with them to pay my doctor for a preventative care visit that should be paid at 100%.,1,BCBS Florida
41,Now in YOUR enrollment you cannot trust this insurance. This insurance does not have reliable doctors and when you pay the bill for this insurance always charge more. They remember in past months when people placed the invoice in automatic payment and this company took out large amounts of money from the accounts... so I feel frustrated that I pay two months November and December now with the accounts of which is that they say that I have to pay again. WITH THIS INSURANCE YOU CANNOT TRUST ANY SERVICE THAT PRESENTS.,1,BCBS Florida
42,"I have not only paid my premium monthly but on time and in full whenever due. I have been with them since February of 2017. Since then I've had them take my money and cancel my policy, change my PCP without my knowledge and give me another PCP without my knowledge and when I found out about it and called to make an appointment that Dr. Doesn't see new patient for just under 2 years from now. Then when all that gets fixed, my pain management Dr sends me a bill stating from 04-17 till now 10-17 they have refused paying my Dr because the paperwork states my insurance was not available at those times. YET meanwhile, I'm still paying my premiums. How the hell is that legal for one and 2 we even have period that it's still being paid!",1,BCBS Florida
43,"The FL BCBS website is undoubtedly the worst site I have ever used. On the occasions I can actually access the site, it stops and I get the message that it is unresponsive. This has been going on for a year. I have called on several occasions and am told they are aware of the problem and ""working on it"". I have attempted to use the site from other servers, computers, and internet providers. Nothing works. Please investigate!!!",1,BCBS Florida
44,Buyer Beware. FL Blue deceptive and incompetent. I was approved in 11/9/2016 for both eyelid and brow surgery. Dr ** mother died. Appointment changed till 12/28/16. I was recovering from bad cold. Anesthesiologist suggest postponed till January. On 1/6/17 told not covered for brow surgery. No reason given. Normal procedure are approved for 90 day window.,1,BCBS Florida
45,"Last year I changed from FL BLUE PPO to an HMO as it was too costly for me. Since January 2017 I have been trying to get an appointment with the chosen primary Dr. Everytime I called appointments are for 2 months later. I changed Dr. in May for which I never received my new card. Now in late September I tried AGAIN to secure a new primary Dr, so that I can go in, as I have important health issues.",1,BCBS Florida
46,"I signed up for BCBS FL through healthcare.gov as there weren't any other options available to me. I paid the first month and signed up for autopay. I was never sent a notice via snail mail, e-mail or phone (though BCBS has all) but my insurance was canceled due to non-payment. I was notified by doctors who received a notice I was terminated (BCBS let THEM know but not me...). 3 hours later, I was re-instated with apologies for my inconvenience at their mistake. ",1,BCBS Florida
47,"I have Florida Blue HMO, I was put in a plan with a $7000 deductible. I pay full price when I go to the doctors, not copayment. It really sucks. Now I can't change till next year when the open enrollment is available again. I go to the doctor 2X/year. I will never make this deductible. My prescriptions are now $5 from $1. My advice is make sure that the person completely explains what all the health care terminology means & what it entails.",3,BCBS Florida
48,I signed up for Florida Blue though healthcare.gov and was happy with the service. I had an affordable payment for my son and I for good health coverage. A problem when my auto payment was stopped by Florida Blue and they subsequently kicked me out of my plan. I called and they agreed to reinstate me if I paid the 2-3 months that had lapsed from auto pay. I did pay them over $500 for the past months that they did not collect my payment through auto pay to reinstate my plan. I received a letter within a week stating that I was dropped form Florida Blue due to non-payment. The problem began when Florida Blue updated their system and accidentally kicked out everyone in auto pay. ,1,BCBS Florida
49,"This insurance was picked for me via the market place because my previous insurance Coventry One dropped out of Obama Care... The monthly premiums is definitely higher. I searched for a cheaper insurance but they were all off brand companies, I was afraid to trust them. So I kept FLORIDA BLUE HEALTH. Wednesday 8/2/2017 was my first time using the insurance. They picked the doctor from their FLORIDA BLUE CLINICS. I made an appt. Was surprised that the wait was not long at all. The staff and doctor were super nice. Went back for labs on 8/5/2017--the wait was less than an hour. The lab technician was super nice. ",5,BCBS Florida
50,"I had to sign up for the Affordable Healthcare Insurance. The only insurance available to me was Florida Blue. I signed for the health package and also created an autopay for the $813/month payment. After the first month, nothing was paid from my bank account. After numerous calls to Florida Blue, I was told over and over that the system was having issues and the amounts would be withdrawn the following month with no penalty or fees. When trying to visit a walk-in clinic, I found out my account was canceled two months prior.",1,BCBS Florida
51,"I had a Florida Blue plan through my employer (a health insurance agency ironically) and regretted every second of it. This plan totally screwed my affairs. I've had my medications denied - after verifying the formulary, my doctor wasn't covered and I ended up having to pay out of pocket even though he was a covered physician in their directory. If you like hidden deductibles, stopping your medication for a couple days each month, and stress - this plan is for you...",1,BCBS Florida
52,"I had Florida Blue through Healthcare Marketplace. Unfortunately my tax credit was removed for May & June because we are self employed & it took us a little longer to get our taxes turned in. I paid the ridiculous premium amount in May of nearly $1400 - thanks to help from a friend. I could not afford to do it again for June. Thankfully, Healthcare Marketplace reinstated our tax credit for June - I enrolled in a NEW policy which just so happened to be with Fla Blue & was same type of policy I had before. I called them & explained my situation. The woman was very nice & took my July premium payment & assured me it would be applied for July since it was a NEW enrollment from the Marketplace plus since I was appealing the tax credit being taken away that I had 3 months (now 2 months since June was over) to pay the June premium. She actually placed me on hold for a while so she could verify this information. ",1,BCBS Florida
53,"I have Florida Blue's premier PPO plan but I still cannot get through to a human being. Twice my insurance has been canceled through no fault of my own. The first time I send a payment that was about.14 cents too much. Florida Blue deposited the payment but canceled my insurance and it took me about 40 hours on the phone to get my insurance reinstated during which many of my prescriptions were unavailable. The second time they canceled my insurance was because I sent my payment in early. Again, they deposited the check but canceled my insurance.",1,BCBS Florida
54,"What A Mess At Blue Cross. At the end of October 2016 I turned 65 so I went on Medicare. Called to cancel just my part of the plan. The telephone operator cancelled me and my wife. She wouldn't reinstate just my wife. My wife had no medical coverage for Oct, Nov & Dec 2016. I applied for 2017 during open enrollment in Nov. 2016 for 2017. Paid every payment for 7 months. One month my wife has insurance. Next month no insurance. This is a nightmare. Now they are saying we owe money. I have every receipt for every premium for the last 7 months. No claims during that period. When will this nightmare end???",1,BCBS Florida
55,"Florida Blue has done nothing but drag me around the dirt and back through it again. They are so very unprofessional. I have had them for 3 years or more. Up until this last year they were great. This year Fl Blue has messed up my account since February all of which was their fault. They couldn't accept payments due to their system, customer service wasn't communicating with my case and much more ALL OF WHICH WAS THEIR FAULT. I tried to get to the bottom of it and pay my bill but every time they had messed things up. Finally when I fixed it they made me pay $250 for their mistake. I then canceled my account weeks ago and what happens... I get a call saying I haven't paid. NEVER GET FL BLUE OR USE MARKETPLACE.",1,BCBS Florida
56,First problem with this company is I have advised them of my email 5 times and yet nothing fixed or added so I can get the information I need about my account especially if anything changes. Second they feel they can debit any amount of money as they did yesterday without my knowledge. I didn't approve $441 when my monthly bill is supposed to be $276. It takes hours before you can get to a rep that never has any answers. Third they can't seem to get my address correct which is the one I signed up with. They are in violation of HIPA law sending my explanation of benefits to an address I had three years ago that they have in their system from when I had Blue Cross with my ex-husband. One policy has nothing to do with the other and the old address should have been taken out which I've called about three times told it was fixed to be lied to again. I can't even go on to view my bill because they haven't sent me a security code.,1,BCBS Florida
57,Called BCBS spoke to customer service & provided CPT CODES for a procedure. Was informed by BCBS representative procedure covered and responsible for $50 copay. Getting bills from doctor as stating non covered... BCBS states now that it is not covered in my policy. This BS with these Insurance Companies needs to stop. They increase our policy by HUGE AMOUNTS every year. BCBS needs to train people that work for them to give accurate information to clients of BCBS. I am tired of calling BCBS and receiving incorrect information. My husband & I started with BCBS Fl almost 6 yrs ago. Our policy was $500 month for both of us 6 years ago and is now $1300+ a month for both of us... This is BS. I have been on hold for 40 minutes with BCBS as I asked for the name of the person I spoke to previously that provided incorrect information.,1,BCBS Florida
58,"I have read through many of the review here and our story is very similar. They refuse coverage for various reasons and every time we contact them we either can't understand them or they say they will resolve the problem within ""X"" amount of days and nothing ever gets resolved. The situation just keeps getting worse and worse. They take our premium payment each month but refuse to cover our expenses. We just had a baby in Dec. 2016 and ever since then, everything with FL Blue has been a mess! I am so fed up with the amount of time and stress this has placed on our family! We need to group together and do something people!!",1,BCBS Florida

Since then I contacted them 8 times without success. While the initial reasons for denial were fixed within one call, they kept dodging settling the claims. I have written proof from customer support dept about their lies and self-contradictions about how the case is being handled. I have finally filed complaints about my claims with state of FL. Will it help? Is it worth pursuing a lawsuit as they have repeatedly lied to me about the progress of the claims. I have lost all trust in them.",1,BCBS Florida

Since my new job offers benefits I need to cancel my FL Blue plan. I called (simply seeking information about the cancellation process). The women on the line wouldn't even let me finish a sentence before interrupting me and telling me to call back during business hours. (I asked her what those hours were and she ""didn't know""). When I asked her name she hung up on me.",1,BCBS Florida
61,Paid premiums and my insurance was not active. Called over 10 times to fix the problem and customer service rep said I did not make a payment.

No one calls back and to get a supervisor on the phone is a miracle. As I have waiting on the phone for over an hour every time I call.

63,"This insurance company is an absolute joke. My family member pays over $1000 a month on coverage and required knee injections as an alternative to surgery. She got the injections for years without an issue. All of a sudden Florida Blue decides to stop covering these medications altogether. Meanwhile, we never got a phone call. We didn't hear that anything was denied until WE called. Such poor customer service to not even let the customer know, on top of the fact that there is no reason this medication should be denied when it was paid for in the past. What is the point of paying insurance companies if they won't pay for what you NEED? Again, absolute joke of a company.",1,BCBS Florida
64,"My daughter has been on the phone with BCBS for two weeks or longer with no satisfaction. They should be ashamed of themselves. The bank sent electronic payments to them and they claim they never received. BCBS will not talk directly with the bank so the bank sent several faxed copies of the electronic transfer of payments. BCBS claimed they did not receive the fax, so my daughter went to the bank and got a copy of the payment and faxed it herself. They still claim it will be another 7 to 10 days to process the fax. Two electronic payments sent and they want to drop her insurance. Is this because she is ready to deliver my baby grandson. Shame on them and their no service customer service.",1,BCBS Florida

And to make it worse, my 2 choices within 30 miles are planned parenthood. I live in an urban area. I pay around $500 a month and have terrible coverage. They are trying to blame the government for this. They cannot upgrade my insurance plan. So I am stuck for a year. Paying $500 a month.

It's not guaranteed, but it's one more step you can take. ** I decided to do this after never getting my overbilling issues taken care of by repeated calls to BCBS. So far, BCBS has not terminated me for nonpayment of bogus billing, but I can see it coming, based on what I have read here on this website. The phone agents say my account looks fine - I am paid up, and acknowledge the online billing is totally whack, and they assure me I won't be terminated for the bogus billing, but guess what, I don't feel reassured!!! I am getting the jump on this before they do. I have already received a one month overdue notice on bogus billing. I guess I have a couple more to go before they will terminate me for nonpayment of bogus bills. Wish me luck.",1,BCBS Florida

Also, I seem to be paying more in general for BlueCare as compared to straight Medicare. I would like someone to let me know. I was given a form from a doctor that had a list of medications on it that I was to research and find out what was covered. I didn't know the names of most of the drugs let alone the various dosages which are prescribed. I had a real struggle trying to get copay amounts from the Bluecare rep.

71,"Once I had to actually start using my insurance, I have had nothing but problems. I had my daughter last year. I called to add her to my policy the day she was born. I should have waited. Part of the blame goes to the Marketplace, but most of the problems I have had I believe are firmly the fault of FL Blue. According to my Marketplace account she was officially on the policy, but FL Blue did not have any record of her. They don't tell you that in order to add a dependent they will be cancelling your policy and starting a new one. I tried to use my insurance for follow-up care after the delivery and kept getting it rejected. She had to be admitted to the NICU and then transferred to the NICU at the children's hospital about an hour away.",1,BCBS Florida
72,I am astounded by the amount of complaints against Florida Blue health insurance and so relieved I am not the only one dealing with it. What they are doing is illegal by accepting premium payments they agreed to and not insuring people with any coverage and making people look like criminals by not paying the doctors who perform their service. I have been dealing with a lot of the same issues that other people are having - premium amount is not the same as what I signed up for. Cancelling my plan because I did not pay my premium which I did. Cancelling my 5 year old daughter off because she MIGHT be eligible for KID Care which she is not nor did I sign her up for it. Denied claims for not being covered when told you were. Being registered under 2 plans when I did not sign up for 2 plans. ,1,BCBS Florida
73,"Blue Cross has had my account screwed up since August/September of 2016. My husband was placed on Medicare and we were informed to cancel insurance and for me to re-apply for myself. Unfortunately it was incorrect information and it sent the ball rolling in the wrong direction. I have since tried to remedy this with Blue Cross and it hasn't worked! I have approximately 10 confirmation numbers and have probably spent over 40 hours on the phone with these people trying to get my insurance sorted out. They have me down as having 3 different policies, I paid my money over the phone for January and February of 2017 yet they have denied payment to Drs. Now the Drs are billing me and Blue Cross won't stop billing me. It's a different story every time you talk to someone.",1,BCBS Florida
74,"Member services is a JOKE!!! Spent an hour and a half, most of it on hold while they look for information. They are ALL Spanish speaking with poor English skills. They are unable to access the claims in question and keep telling ME to contact my last employer for the information.

How can they help with questions about claims to which they are not given access??? WTH??? Such BS!!!",1,BCBS Florida
75,"This company, which has a damn monopoly on the horrible mess that is Obamacare, is miserable. I set up autodraft which worked in Jan. It did not work in Feb due to their incompetence. They canceled my account. I had to reactivate it. I was hung up on several time from their foreign answering service. They said, ""I see. You have autodraft set up, however, it did not work""??? What the hell does that mean? Now they took 3 months payment at once, last week. I get a call today saying I owe money? When I told them they took my money, they hung up on me again. I want to strangle someone. Rude P.O.S. This company sucks. If I could give 0 stars I would. How is it a marketplace when you only have one choice?",1,BCBS Florida
76,Prescription coverage - I see I'm not the only one to have problems with Florida Blue and Prime Therapeutics. I'll be short and to the point. They are giving me the runaround with nothing getting done. They never get the info that me or the doctor sends even though we can prove we sent it with a code or receipt. Short of going to the media and filing a complaint. I guess that's all I can do. What a joke they are. I have rights.,1,BCBS Florida
77,I noticed while reconciling my accounts in early December 2016 that there had not been a dental premium charge for the months of September and October 2016. I have auto payment set up for this plan. In November 2016 the charges began applying again however they were for the amt $65.37 (previously the premium had been $73.26). So I called on 12-8-16 to find out what was going on and the guy told me that my account had been cancelled in Sept. He said something about a new computer systems and that they sent out letters. I told him I didn't receive any letters. He replied that the mailing was imperfect and I was not the first person that had this problem and that he would reinstate my plan.,1,BCBS Florida
78,"Paid my premium for January then they cancelled my coverage without telling me. When I called no one could tell me what was going on. Talked to 20 reps and 2 supervisors. Some said they would send it to the appropriate department to get fixed. This went on for 3 months, no coverage, no reason, no one seemed to know or care what's was going on. Spoke with the marketplace 5 times which they send notices to Florida Blue for results. Then last week I received membership cards and they said I was effective January 1st and they wanted money for Feb and March after they told me I wasn't covered. This is so stressful and will effect my taxes unfairly. This is not over.",1,BCBS Florida
79,"MY reason for this review is that I have been suffering the terrible business of Fl Combined Life. I had FL Blue both for medical and dental last year and had almost no problems. They covered my expenses. The only real problem I had is that they did not want to pre-approve the chiro, they wanted me to go first and then see if I was approved and I simply cannot afford that on the beans I make. I never used the dental plan but paid all year. ",3,BCBS Florida
80,Florida Blue used to be a good company now it sucks. Phone calls to them go out of the US and those people just don't care. I tried asking for someone that could help me in the US but they just sent me back to the call center. On top of that I pay double what I was paying.,1,BCBS Florida
81,I changed my plan through the marketplace in Dec 2016. Florida Blue as of the 3rd week of January had the old plan with much higher copays. I was told by a Florida Blue rep that the plan would be changed effective 02/01/2017 and since I didn't use the insurance in January because of Florida Blue mistake... I would not have to pay the January premium. My paperwork still shows that the new plan is effective 02/01/2017 but Florida Blue has now backdated the plan to January 1 and wants me to pay the premium. The reps from Florida Blue admit their mistake but say I have to pay for insurance I did not use. I canceled all healthcare appts in month of January because of what I was told.,1,BCBS Florida
82,"Jan 3rd, my insurance premium was taken out of my account twice, I discovered the matter immediately and called to follow up. The issue being they claimed, when Market Place sent the info over to them they sent the wrong info so there was a problem with setting up the account... Which also initially caused issues with coverage the beginning week of Jan. After talking to 4 people in January I was able to get the coverage issues straightened out. However, I have been unable to get my refund. As of today's date I am sitting on hold with Florida Blue still trying to get my refund for the duplicate premium that they withdrew from my account in January. Mind you the premium is the amount of a house payment, so if it is withdrawn twice that is an issue.",1,BCBS Florida
83,"Initially, experience was good. Then, at some point, billing or management arrangements within Florida Blue changed. Quarterly invoices for my individual dental plan would arrive after the due date. So, I would call and pay the premium over the phone. The January 2017 quarterly invoice never came (& I never noticed that I did not get it). Today, March 23, 2017, I received the invoice for the quarterly premium due on April 1, 2017, with the amount due as $0. ",1,BCBS Florida

This claim is still not processed and we need the disposition letter from Florida Blue in order to submit this claim to our travel insurance (CSA). Florida Blue has 1) asked us to re-submit the original packet; 2) passed the claim on to their Global World division (it was established during a FL Blue conference call that this claim is not covered by Global); 3) asked us to re-submit other materials; 4) sent us emails with attachments that we cannot read; 5) has today passed this claim on to their SIU division (special investigating unit) because the claim is more than $500.",1,BCBS Florida

I was in the middle of having a shot procedure done for stenosis of the neck when my insurance had to change. I've been waiting since January to get authorization from Florida Blue to continue the treatment which would result in my no longer needing opioid drugs for pain. They have yet to approve the treatment, so I'm still on opioids which they seem fine with (what about the opioid epidemic that is sweeping America??). I finally reached out myself since my doctor's office can't seem to get anywhere with them and was told that they could not discuss the reason for the delay with ME!! THE PATIENT!!

86,My husband & I spoke with an attorney today about suing FL BCBS for nonpayment of 15k in hospital bills. We knew we were trying to have a child in 2016 so we purchased the best insurance coverage possible and were set up on autopay. In September my husband noticed a debit had not been made so he called and made payment over the phone along with paying the remaining premium for the year because the baby was due in December & we didn't want to run the risk of running into any trouble.,1,BCBS Florida
87,"In 2015 we had FB 1 month and they canceled us for not paying our premium. We paid what they told us to and then they raised the rate and told us we should have checked online to see if there was a status change. We were never able to access the online service and was never able to see anything at all for the first 2 mos. 3 mos we called them and thought we were filing a complaint to be reinstated, but at the end of the 3 mos they told us we never filed the complaint. They told us we had to do it online. Online said we had to do it by phone. We lost our ins and had to get ins thru another company. We paid 2000.00 extra on our taxes for not have ins coverage for 2 mos. In 2016 the 1st mo they canceled our ins again, didn't tell us they had changed our card number. All doctors were denied payment. This time we watched the online notification closely and found they no longer had that coverage and we had to choose another from them.",1,BCBS Florida
88,I attempted to cancel my policy in Dec of 2016 as I was getting new insurance with AvMed. I noticed in Feb that FL Blue had charged my account for two months premiums for my son and I ($2382.44). After multiple online chats and phone calls they are telling me they are unable to process a premium refund although I have proof of new insurance and no claims were made against my policy. They mysteriously have no record of my cancellation in December. Florida Blue does not care about their customers or their well-being and they have lost a customer for life.,1,BCBS Florida
89,"Started in September 2016 when new child was born. We attempted to add newborn to his mothers plan and could not. For what reason I don't know and can't remember as there was so much BS being said by Florida Blue at the time such as ""Our system is changing over and we can't find your account."" So much time had gone by I decided to enroll in my own insurance plan through healthcare.gov and add our kids to my plan. After completing the application and selecting plans for the whole family excluding wife (has her own plan) we totaled up a premium of $847/month. After 2 months of waiting to be 'allowed' to pay our binder payment we get a bill for $1400+. By this time 2017 enrollment period was opening up and decided to just put myself and leave kids on FL Healthy Kids. I informed Florida Blue to cancel the old plan since we did not make the binder payment anyway.",1,BCBS Florida
90,"Florida Blue have not paid claims for bills sent to them over 6 months ago. Excuse after excuse, computers fault, wrong code, not insured, to name a few. All premiums paid on auto pay, Florida Ins Commission involved, Florida Blue lied to them saying the matter was sorted. Now cannot get blood tests from Quest, and now collection agents involved. Promises and more promises, really in essence just a bunch of liars. Used to be with Aetna. Never a problem but moved to Florida and landed with this joke of a company. How can you as a company train your employees to lie on a consistent basis. Do not go with these people. $1700 per month for this aggravation.",1,BCBS Florida
91,"I have been a client of Florida Blue for some time and as of Sept 2016 everything has gone South! I have spent better than 200 hours on the phone with Florida Blue - documenting every call, who I talked to, reference numbers for the calls, people I spoke to, if managers got involved - the whole event. It has been MADDENING! It started in Sept when they separated the bills from medical and dental together to separating them. When I paid for the medical and dental - they were not applying the dental portion to dental. In Oct 2016 I was told I owed 3 months of dental, that I already paid every month along with the medical, but yet CONVENIENTLY the medical did not show a credit for the dental payments applied to medical?!? So the money was missing. Once they discovered this - they credited my medical and I had to pay 3 months to make up for my dental.",1,BCBS Florida
92,"I have had so many problems with Florida Blue since last year. They don't bill properly. I don't make enough money for assistance, so I only have a 1 month grace period. In April, I had brain surgery. They had not billed me properly and didn't process my payment in time so they dropped me days after my surgery. I've had to make multiple payments for it to actually go through. My premium went up an extra $100 without warning for this year. ",1,BCBS Florida
93,"I paid for coverage through the marketplace (which is a HUGE government scam). Trying to make a doctor appointment and they tell me I have no coverage. I call BCBSFL who states I didn't pay my invoice. I was on auto-pay but their system had a 'burp' and kicked out 250,000 Floridians without letting us know. I send them a copy of the email confirmation showing paid and call again (on hold each time over 30 minutes) and a friendly woman tells me they messed up on their end and added numbers wrong which is why I have no coverage. She tells me she fixed everything and I ask for a reference number.",1,BCBS Florida
94,"This company has no idea what is going on. They do not communicate between departments, they are terribly trained, usually unprofessional, and clearly understaffed. I've spent nearly 15 hours on the phone with them in just the last three weeks. Most of this is on hold but I've been hung up on, incorrectly transferred, and had to start every process request over again with each new rep.",1,BCBS Florida
95,Monthly premium charged two months after cancellation. I was notified of cancellation on 2-02-17 via email at 10:32 pm. The payment for Feb. went through my bank that day. Florida Blue representative told me my policy terminated on 1-01-17. Jan. payment also was paid. Money wasn't returned. I had to call the Marketplace myself and was told a case manager will work on this and it could take up to 30 days. I have paid 2 months for insurance I don't have.,1,BCBS Florida
96,"I purchased a health insurance policy for me and my son in 2016 through the marketplace with Florida Blue. My experience in 2016 was a smooth deal and with very little hiccups. In November 2016 I received a letter from Florida Blue directly stating that if I wanted to continue with the same coverage, that I didn't need to do anything that my policy will renew automatically. Even though my new monthly fee had increase by $75.00, I still decided to stay with Florida Blue because of my experience until this point had been satisfactory. So I put the letter away and having the issue of renewal handled (at least so I thought).",1,BCBS Florida
97,"I cancelled my policy 3 weeks before the following month, received confirmation number and spoke to two different people to verify policy is cancelled and to stop automatic payments and was told there will be no money withdraws. Well they lied, mislead me, blew smoke up my **. They took the monthly payment after hours on the phone to verify. I was a customer for many many years and will never use this company again.",1,BCBS Florida
98,I paid on Dec 23 2016 for Jan 2017 month. I have been trying to obtain prescriptions during Jan and been told by Walgreens I am Not recognized. I spoke to a lady called Ursula who confirmed I was paid but their two Systems did and have not talked to each other. She was third person who said they would send communications to get me available for meds. This had been going on for nearly 3 weeks!!!,1,BCBS Florida
99,"So this is what happened, I included myself and my 2 kids to the policy and had to wait almost a month to start using the insurance. When I called to find a dental surgeon for myself (I mentioned this when I was signing up) I was told I had a 6 month waiting period!!! And in the meantime I could use their discount program for 6 months!!! So basically they only cover cleaning, x-rays (every dentist does) and check-ups or ""monitoring"". LOL. So if you have a cavity or something needs to be fixed before 6 months you pay a discounted rate, and get his kids under 19 don't need a waiting period, however none of mine were included on the policy!!! This is a scam and I am cancelling!",1,BCBS Florida
100,"This insurance company should be banned. Early January Florida Blue called to ask me if I have paid. They said that they merged computer systems and not all information was updated. Finally my payments were up to date. I received the invoice for payment due on February 1 on January 30th. It is as if they want to cancel you for nonpayment by sending invoices out late. I made an electronic payment on January 26th. Funds cleared my bank of January 27 and payment still has not been applied to my account as of February 2nd. When I called Florida Blue, they said call back in 5 business days. Again they should be banned.",1,BCBS Florida
101,"FloridaBlue failed to provide me with ID card, with an invoice, with any assistance throughout the last few months. Their failure to produce a bill, to provide (ID), failure to reinstate cancellation due to their error in billing, intentionally refusing to return phone calls as promised, Then, I read an article searching for FlBlue website. I read an article from 1-9th, 2017 edition of the Sun Sentinel (East coast West Palm Beach paper) as told by a brave FlBlue member whose child was denied access to Dr and had to pay Dr due to incorrectly losing the coverage.",1,BCBS Florida
102,"I regret so much renewing my Blue Medicare plan in 2017. But, it was the only plan accepted by my primary doctor. My low satisfaction with Florida Blue is due to the following: (1) Website not responding. (2) Waiting time of 39 mins to get a dropped call once a customer rep answers. (3) Excess Paper mail... including a 2017 Calendar! OMG I'm on Medicare but an online ""junkie"" since the First Apple phone & iPad. (4) Prescriptions are more expensive in their preferred pharmacies. (5) Medical providers options keeps on shrinking while cost increases. Those are the main reasons I will not give them another chance for 2018. I rather switch primary doctor than continue with Florida Blue...",1,BCBS Florida
103,"I became a new member this year with Florida Blue. I recently scheduled a visit, made my blood work and CT scan appointments. My complaint so far and I really shouldn't have one this early in the game is that their website sucks. I've tried to login using different browsers and it's all the same. A little blue circle going around and around and around. Not good.",1,BCBS Florida
104,I waste a whole day at their office several times a year. All the same issues as the other complaints. Not the fault of the employees at the office. They really try but every time it goes to the main office the problems reoccur. Been with Blue Shield for 15+ years in Ca and now Fl. My most recent issues are price bait and switch. This has happens 2 times now in the last 2 months. Always done by their employees and always claimed as a computer glitch!,1,BCBS Florida
105,"We have had an active Florida Blue policy for six years. As business owners, our payments are made through the business via automatic deductions (EFT) on the 1st of each month. In the summer of 2016, I received a letter from Florida Blue stating that they were switching payment systems and our payment for September would need to be made manually as opposed to EFT or auto-deduction. So, I dug out my checkbook from under a pile of dust and mailed a check which was received.",1,BCBS Florida
106,"When Florida Blue quit offering their HMO plan here in Pinellas County Fl. as of Dec. 31, 2016, I talked to their salesman who told me that their PPO plan would take its place. That the coverage was nearly the same. I only took it based on what he told me and the fact that my primary care MD was included and I was told the that this new plan, with other than a few minor changes, remained virtually the same as the 2016 HMO contract. At the beginning of the year 2017 I received THE insurance card. Good, wonderful except, that it was for their HMO, the now nonexistent plan. I notified them of their mistake. I was told to just tear up that card, they would issue me the PPO card and I also told them that I was still waiting for some books describing whatever they offered via the PPO plan. ",1,BCBS Florida
107,"I too am having so many problems with Blue Cross. I had Blue Cross in my younger years and they use to be a great company. Fast forward to today and it's now a nightmare. My insurance company that I had in 2016 sent me a letter stating they would no longer be operating in Florida and I needed to find another Insurance Co. The only one that is available to me is Blue Cross so I went with them. Well, I signed up for a plan and paid for the first month. The paperwork stated I had 30 days and if I didn't like it I could change plans. After looking it over I realized it wasn't my best choice so I switched right away to another one.",1,BCBS Florida
108,I called ghetto company this afternoon to schedule an apt 4 times. Each time their automated service looked up and verified my account and then when I requested an apt I was disconnected. In my frustration went into the office to make an apt was told it would only be a few moments to see an associate so I waited on with only two people ahead of me and after one hour had not been addressed nor had one of the people ahead of me. Witnessed 7 BCBS employees in their glass offices not one helping a customer. Customer service in this company does not exist. My reason for wanting an appointment is because we do not receive our bills cannot get them online and actually get dunning letters because we haven't paid when we don't know what to pay. My insurance alone is over $1400.00 per month and they cannot even provide us a bill. God help us if I get sick.,1,BCBS Florida
109,"Let me first inform everyone I have been with BCBS in another state since 2003 (for 13 years) with no complaints. I also work in the health care system that raved on this insurance and recommended it to my very own patients. As of August of 2016, and moving to a different state with two changes of address later, I received a letter from BCBS of Florida. They would be experiencing a ""system upgrade"". Since that system upgrade you can no longer view your bill online, make payments or view any past history of payments (which was nice to refer back to which in the past you could).",1,BCBS Florida
110,"I cannot begin to list every problem I've had with Florida Blue--it would take pages. Suffice it to say they are just like the others I read on this page. Here's a brief summary: I've been charged retroactively for health care during the time I had no health care (The government subsidy was undoubtedly paid for this too, so think fraud against the govt). When I receive threats to cancel my policy if I don't send in something I've already sent, I'm told in person ""Just ignore it."" So they will have paper proof while I just have verbal non-proof when they cancel! I've been lied to many times. My policy has been cancelled for nonpayment, then my payment refunded. The price goes up. ",1,BCBS Florida
111,"I'm not sure where to start. Long ago, I discovered that if Florida Blue (FB) got your $ through an error in their processing, you would have to follow up and follow up and follow up to get them to do their job and make the appropriate adjustment. But this year, they've overdone themselves in their ability to pass the responsibility for resolving THEIR problems to their insurers!! ",1,BCBS Florida
112,"Blue Cross canceled my policy in August (they said it was per my request) - it wasn't. They sent me a new policy and card and said that I had to make a binder payment. I did. The following month they said it was an error to use my old policy and card. Since September they are saying I am delinquent in my payments (they can't figure out how to put the payment from one account to the other). I have been on the phone many many times with all different responses (each time at least an hour). Some tell me ""ok we will fix it"" and it never is. I am at my wits end and don't know what to do.",1,BCBS Florida
113,I cancelled my plan in December before the beginning of the new year... on January third they charged me the full premium about as if I continued with this insurance. Do upon speak with the customer service person they told me I cancelled in January... total lie 1. Then they told me that they would have to send me a check as a refund within ten days. I have now waited over two weeks and two phone calls and they say it's in process... why do I feel like they will charge me again in February and blame me... The big problem is this. It comes out of my business account and if I deposit said check it looks like income so now I have to pay tax on it again. I could go on forever about detail of care with medication for the past two years but hey I guess they don't really care.,1,BCBS Florida

115,"My family has had insurance through Marketplace with Florida Blue the last two years. No big deal - rates were ok, coverage was decent, we had insurance. The plan changed year to year which was a pain - but still no big deal. My husband is a cancer survivor so insurance of course is very important to us. For 2017 I was lucky enough to get a new job that had insurance coverage - awesome. So I went ahead and went through all the channels to make sure Marketplace wasn't renewed, called to confirm cancellation of account with Florida Blue 3 times - all saying yes all set. January 3rd - they take an automatic unauthorized deduction of $1356 out of our bank account. I have NO policy with them! I have cancelled 3 times to make sure! I call immediately - it take 4 different agents to stop transferring me automatically to Marketplace to start to get a resolution to this. I don't know about anyone else but $1356 out of the bank is huge! ",1,BCBS Florida
116,"Signed up through marketplace to start insurance January 1, 2017. Made payment on time but can't access any services simply because they can't find my account!?! They found it when I had to make a payment. Cannot access web portal, it says information I entered is incorrect. Have not received any mail or information from them, it is already January 18 and nothing. I called customer service at least 6 times to solve the problem and to be able to use the service I PAID FOR, and nothing. They say they're going to update something and they never do anything. Two different calls, one person said I hadn't made the payment, the other person said they see my payment!?!? They took my money, don't let me use the service and don't care about resolving the issue. Sounds like a SCAM to me. Anyone know of any government agencies that can protect us from that? Maybe the police?",1,BCBS Florida
117,"Florida Blue has been putting my payment on someone else accounts and then telling me I owe more money and they won't fix the issues.

118,"Anything that can go wrong will. I've been double billed, had my automatic bill payments stop working and then unexpectedly lost coverage, had my plan suddenly disappear and they assigned me to another one not of my choice, etc. They're a perfect example of the insurance companies being shameless thieves who don't care about you. The worst. Prepare to discover their non-stop screwups and to spend hours on the phone on hold, only to resolve nothing.",1,BCBS Florida
119,"We updated our policy and got a real good deal. Now we paid the first amount of 200 some dollars, but they still took 600 some dollars out for the old plan even though it was cancelled on December 16th. Took my wife approximately 6 hours on the phone!!! to get a refund approved. First they said they wouldn't refund us. Are you kidding me they made an error and I have to pay over 600$ for it? So now it will take about a month to get the refund??? What the heck?! It doesn't take a month to take my money but it takes a month to refund it?",1,BCBS Florida

I have been having health issues for months but had to cancel my previous insurance through the marketplace because I just could not afford a $14,500 deductible. I did this in June of 2016. Over a month ago I realized that my family has to have the coverage so I applied through the marketplace again, chose a plan and made my payment. I then went ahead and scheduled needed dr appointments for this month when I ""thought"" I should have coverage. I am still not covered and have been on the phone with various people for weeks and nobody seems to be able to tell me what the problem is. In the meantime the health of myself and my family is deteriorating. I am unable to get coverage after hours of holding on the phone, of being lied to that things will be fixed within a week... It's now the 14th and I still have no coverage and no answers as to why.",1,BCBS Florida
121,These customer service representatives are taught to lie to customers. Have to be in the line for hours to reach a customer representatives then they lie continuously.

123,"Florida Blue changed billing systems in October. Thus, they stopped sending bills via mail and online. Therefore, countless customers inadvertently didn't pay their bills. Florida Blue used it as a way to cancel their insurance renewals. I spent tens of hours trying to rectify the situation. I finally passed the phone to a healthcare attorney and was able to get the issue resolved. WHAT ABOUT THE ELDERLY? THE DISABLED? THE MARGINALIZED? The person who doesn't have tens of hours to spend on the phone? How will they get justice? A class action lawsuit is in order. They are in violation of countless healthcare laws.",1,BCBS Florida

He has complex medical needs. He was born with no ears, no jaw joint, no cheekbones, choanal atresia (bone is blocking his nose holes), cleft palate and a severe recessed jaw. He was born without the ability to breathe at all and has a tracheostomy as well as a G-tube since he cannot eat or swallow. Florida Blue has denied my son to have pediatric nursing in our home as well as a medical crib so we can bathe him, perform his daily trach care and resuscitate him if need be. He came home for a few days before Christmas and was Bayflited back to the hospital on Christmas Day due to becoming unresponsive. He had trouble breathing and my husband and I had to bag him with oxygen over his crib rails while calling 911.",1,BCBS Florida
125,"You can read any review below and it should be fairly similar to this one. I signed up through the marketplace and followed all steps. Through an error on Florida Blue I paid for two plans. I have received 4 different answers ranging from ""you'll have coverage in 24-48 hrs all the way to Feb 1st"". WOW! 7 days later I still have no coverage therefore no medications. I've run out of one that's pretty serious. They don't care. It seems I'm not the only one to experience this and in the future will find a new company even if I have to pay more to avoid this company. It's a joke and is causing serious problems because they can't do their jobs!",1,BCBS Florida
126,"I had the opportunity, unpleasant opportunity to speak with a handful of ""Customer Service"" Reps of this company. Customer Service is an oxymoron with this company. I heard a dozen times. ""I understand"" and ""I apologize"" for the error they made; but NOT ONE person who had the authority to fix it. The INCOMPETENCE was amazing. If it was not so frustrating, it would be funny and make a great SNL skit. Anyone who uses this company for their health insurance is crazy. After hours of speaking to these people, it is clear their employees, are unskilled, untrained or simply do not care. They acknowledge their problem and do not know how to fix it. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS. This was the WORST EXPERIENCE I have had with an insurance company in my life!!",1,BCBS Florida

In December we enrolled in a lower cost plan for January as our plan premium increased by $300 per month. FB has cashed our check for the first month's premium but we do not have any access to the online plan details or insurance cards to show as proof of insurance.

I called BC who advised that my plan (1490B) was no longer offered but the same plan listed as 1490 was available but now the premium was $404.

The website will not recognize the information printed on my card after multiple attempts. When calling there is the usual attempt to have you hang up by making you pass through multiple menus. When finally connecting I was told that I had a 40 minute wait. This company along with others in the medical insurance field seem to have policies in place to minimize their cost to serve their customers and maximize profits and CEO pay. More regulation is needed to ensure that they provide the minimum of service.,1,BCBS Florida

I should check back to see if the money is there in about a WEEK, and then call back if it isn't. They took my money in 24 hours but can't give it back for more than a week, the week of Christmas!!!

138,Multiple scams which reviews show are probably purposeful ploys on the part of this monstrous company. I wonder how many Florida Blue members would be interested in a class action suit. I too experienced the scam of their APO payment system flaw and cancellation of insurance without notice and then delay in reinstatement after taking full payment and being told it was active but was not reactivated.

143,"I have been dealing with Florida Blue and their incompetence since I had surgery in June. They have misplaced premium payments for July and August. With that same problem they were telling me that since I had received my insurance through the Affordable Care Act, that my tax credit had been cancelled and it was no longer active. I spoke with a representative at the Marketplace and I was told that my tax credit was still active and the information Florida Blue had given me was incorrect. Florida Blue has horrible customer service. Every time you call them the representative always says that the system that they use has not been updated with the system that actually processes the payment of your premiums. ",1,BCBS Florida
144,"I went online to see their rates for health insurance. In the meanwhile I already have health insurance. I was just doing a comparison. They have not stop calling me. They call me all hours. I told him I already have insurance and I'm very happy with my health insurance and they're still calling me. It is Sunday at 10 o'clock in the morning. They called me seven, eight o'clock at night. They call me all hours. They will not stop.",1,BCBS Florida
145,"I moved from California to Florida, and as most health care providers have pulled out of this and other states due to their manipulation of the Affordable Care Act, I was stuck with Florida Blue. We all know how legendary Blue is at terrible customer service, but Florida Blue took it to a new level. As a consumer you only have one option. To talk to the customer service center in the Dominican Republic. My experience has nothing to do with prejudice, or ""keep the jobs in america"". I am socially liberal and if the call center was competent I wouldn't have a problem with it. The problem is that Florida Blue, along with the other ""Each state has it's own independent Blue - to again manipulate the system"" has a brutally incompetent customer service model which is, again, based on how they make money, and how bad they are for patients and the U.S. healthcare system.",1,BCBS Florida
146,"My policy was cancelled without notice telling me my insurance terminated on Dec 31 2015. This I found out when I went for my eye appointment on Nov 14 2016. I was at the same Dr Office in October 2016 several times and Fl Blue paid the EOBs each time, including my Internist appointments. Here we are November 16 2016, frustrated. I've paid each monthly payment. Received notice that my dental has a credit over $1,000. I've called plenty of times and CS, CS Supervisor (she hung up on me after I waited over 1 hr on phone), and CS Recovery refuses to credit my health, advising they would have to issue a refund. I was told by Customer Service and Supervisor that they need to re-key all data, due to a computer problems when changing systems, before going any further in reinstating my policy. Therefore, due to their error I'm without health insurance and my dental has a credit of over $1,000.",1,BCBS Florida
147,How convenient it is that the insurance company would lose my claim (with my original receipts) for reimbursement in the mail. Now I am supposed to fax in my information in with zero confidence that they will A) receive it; B) be able to confirm receipt and C) actually process the claim. They have no incentive to reimburse their customers. Instead they'd rather make it as difficult as possible for us to navigate their claims system than pay for what they are supposed to cover. This is so frustrating. I had to stop seeing this provider because he wouldn't submit the claims himself and I can't keep paying out of pocket without getting reimbursed from BCBS Florida.,1,BCBS Florida
148,"For 2 years I have been trying to get reimbursed for eyeglasses and today after speaking to dozens of representatives I was able to resolve the issue. 2 pieces of information were missing: NPI and provider ID. Miss Joedie ** contacted her supervisor and together they were able to locate to find the problem, input the missing information and resolve the problem. According to the representative (# ref **) the check will be in the mail shortly. I am asking myself at this point of the experience with this insurance company: Who is in charge and hires hundreds of people who cannot figure out a simply problem. Who then does not train them and addresses such issues. How is this company even in existence if 2 simple pieces of information hinder a resolution for 2 years. How does the government allow such business to exist and conduct health related issues?",1,BCBS Florida
149,"I have been trying to obtain my reimbursement for several claims that are outside this horrible FLORIDA BLUE - not only do they say they can't find it, they say they don't have a fax when I call back, and they gave me the fax number. They can't find the claim(s) and then all of sudden ""OH"" it was in /on another screen. I fax put the reference number and then they still can not find my completed medical claim forms. They all of sudden started asking for more detail, which I am happy to provide such as codes, and diagnosis codes etc. ",1,BCBS Florida

I know she doesn't pay it, but they won't cancel the policy and stop sending us bills for her account because they can still collect the $250 per month from the government that covers part of her policy. This should be illegal. I'd report them for it if I knew where. She's a drug addict and she didn't even give us a forwarding address. I've told Florida Blue countless times. I still get the bill. Every month, I throw it in the trash and they collect $250 from the government. ANNOYING.",1,BCBS Florida
151,"I have had Florida Blue insurance for a few years now, not through the Marketplace self-pay. My payments are sent automatically directly from the bank. In July my payment was returned without any notice. I have contacted them numerous times to only be told that a supervisor will need to help, they will call me back, and the company updated their billing system. The information was sent on to the department that can give the approval to reinstate my insurance. Today is October 20, 2016 and I am still waiting on a response from them. The payment was not late and never received any notification from that the policy was being canceled. At this point my only recourse is to get a plan with another company but that means I have to start over again, be certain that my current providers fall within the plans, and probably an increase in already high priced insurance costs.",1,BCBS Florida
152,I have been a customer for three almost four years and have paid with auto pay since the policy was created for dental insurance. Recently the auto pay process stopped working and changes were made to the auto pay system back in August/2016. I received a letter in August stating my insurance premium dropped in price by two dollars (I thought this was nice) and that their system was in the process of changing. It informed me that I had to sign into my account to update or redo my auto pay status. I setup the auto pay online and ended up processing a payment for the new monthly premium for Sept/2016. This is where the problems start.,1,BCBS Florida
153,"So today I get my yearly rate increase, $300 more. I do not have a medical condition nor go to doctors that much, but still I get an increase and with less benefits. Yes less benefits except they did add, that if I decide to have a sex change that will be FREE, but if I get hit from an uninsured motorist I am on my own. Amazing work Florida Blue.",1,BCBS Florida
154,"At the time of the manual August payment request done by Florida Blue, I re-checked and activated the automatic option. At that time, I also requested a Billing History from January 2016 through August 2016. I was told it would arrive in 7-10 working days. Waited two weeks the document did not arrive. To make the long story short, this has happened 6 more times since, have talked to 6 client representatives and 2 Supervisors, the last one I talked to (for slightly more than 1.5 hours) Reginald told me he would personally take care of requesting this information and that he would make sure it would arrive this time. Well, it did not arrive. And even though Reginald failed miserably in following up on the case and did not honor his word, or followed up on what is supposed to be his due diligence, I am more concerned with the fact that FB is not interested in solving what is not happening with their new administrative setup.",1,BCBS Florida
155,"I have had problem after problem with this insurance since January. Everything from mistakes in billing, coverage, and their customer service is terrible every time I call. They do not care about your health and they make it impossible for you to get treatment. I have wasted so much time getting in contact with them so they can fix their billing mistakes is ridiculous. They have had me waiting on the phone for long periods of time, and some reps just hang up when they do not want to search for the answer to your questions. Stay away from this insurance.",1,BCBS Florida
156,"I have had ongoing horrific experiences with BCBS of Florida since the Healthcare Marketplace Started. I have been ""Canceled"" twice in one year so far. Supposedly because I ""didn't send in payments correctly"" that I set up through their auto billing. I fell for this the first time, and then recently, guess what? It happened again! I get so many letters weekly from them that a consumer gets completely fatigued at opening them and if you miss one letter and don't catch all of their ""announcements"" you could be cancelled for multiple of reasons- and trust me they are pro's at ""Losing emails"" and ""no account info"". I reinstated my policy AGAIN in February and made sure that I set up auto draft for my monthly premium amount. I supplied my banking routing number and account number. The CSR said it was all set up and I assumed I was all good.",1,BCBS Florida
157,"I signed up for coverage with the Marketplace in August, for coverage to begin in September. Florida Blue was my only option. I paid my first premium, received a letter on Sept. 1 saying my application was being processed and that I owed $0.00. They finally cashed my check on Sept. 15. I still had no coverage. They told me it was because of a glitch with the new payment system. I was told I would be moved to a high priority category, and my insurance would be activated within 72 hours. It was not. In fact, the next time I called, they claimed I had never even made a payment, and that I just enrolled in the program on September 21, even though I had a letter from them dated Sept. 1 saying they had my application. That is actually what their records were showing!",1,BCBS Florida
158,"The company where I worked used to provide Florida Blue insurance. For almost 3 years I paid their services and the ONLY time I needed to use it, they never confirm my identity with the clinic so I have to pay out my pocket and submit the claim to Florida Blue. Well let me tell you this was a nightmare. I submitted the claim around June 2015 and I waited 3 month for them to process my request just for them to tell me I forgot a signature on the claim, then I submitted again. 3-4 month later they told me I was missing a tax id from the clinic, I submitted AGAIN... It was already 2016 and because they suck my company decided to go with another provider. ",1,BCBS Florida
159,"I am beyond frustrated. It started out that I was given the incorrect effective date and I was being charged a premium higher than the plan I signed up for. Every time I would call I would get a different story. My insurance was cancelled even though I was promised it would not be while the issues were being corrected. I made a payment by MoneyGram to get it there fast; I was given specific instructions that I followed and it was rejected. Whenever I would call, no one could tell me anything. I sent another payment by Express Mail. Again, I was given specific instructions. I spent $25 and the payment should have been applied within 48 to 72 hours. It was lost; found 3 weeks later and finally applied to my account. I was with a different company through the Marketplace last year and did not have any problems. I switched over because BCBS has a good reputation and is supposed to be the best in the business.",1,BCBS Florida
160,"It appears it is taking over a month for Florida Blue to fix their computer system for payments. First we are told auto pay is being changed so you must pay your next bill, so I did. Then I get an email stating I'm past due. I spent a great deal of time holding on the phone to be told it was a computer glitch and I'm paid up to date. I still wasn't able to set up auto pay for my Oct bill. I just went into the system again today 9/21 to reset the auto pay, which they say you can, only to find that my current Oct bill is showing 2 months are being billed. On the phone again to be told I can give this rep my billing info to pay the bill and I can set up auto pay after Oct 1. I want my payment taken from my account Sept 30, but they can't do that.

161,"I have worked several years in the medical industry and I am disgusted at the service of Florida Blue. THEY will deny anything and everything even with Certified Medical Necessity signed by an active registered physician. Even when they DO pay it is below their fee schedule. They cannot even meet the UCR, Usual, Customary and Reasonable... a standard by which Medicare/Medicare sets and regulates. I am dumbfounded at the MANY times I have called and have been transferred to OUTSOURCED jobs in Jamaica, Indonesia, and The Philippines. It's not only a language barrier but then their Customer Service Representatives have NO idea what they are talking about and are basically reading a script.",1,BCBS Florida
162,"I recently reported a ""update life change"" to the Market Place as required by law. Immediately this resulted in Florida Blue cancelling my [paid up to date policy] on August 26, 2016. My Florida Blue online account was also terminated, so I had no access to my past or present medical records. All of my physicians were told I have no coverage. My pharmacy called me that I could not pick up medications ordered due to cancelation of my health policy. I called Florida Blue. I had not been made aware of the termination {no letter was ever sent to me} so I wanted to find out what happened. Florida Blue stated to me there was a glitch internally they called a ""business error."" I was up to date on payments they stated. This took 2 hours to discuss. I was hung up on twice, waiting 25 minutes each time to have a new representative speak with me. I was promised this termination would be corrected the same day.",2,BCBS Florida

165,I had gone to see a neurologist about a severe back problem. The treatment recommended required me driving 45 minutes away for treatment as local facilities would not take Florida Blue. I went once and after seeing the Ct review they wanted me back ASAP. I went 3 days later. My insurance had been cancelled. The Dr offered to wait while I fixed the problem due to the severity of my problems with my spine. I was on the phone for 3 hours. Florida Blue blamed the marketplace and kept referring me back to the marketplace who in turn kept telling me I still had coverage and there was no gap and payments had all been made on their part. Florida Blue said I had made all MY payments and could not give me a reason why I had been cancelled. The doctor's office closed before I could finish the call. The dr. begged me to get this cleared up ASAP as the situation was precarious (her words). ,1,BCBS Florida

Currently I pay 14000 a year for three people and they can screw up the easiest issue. I stopped dealing with them. When I have a problem I go right to the Florida Insurance commission and file a complaint. That usually fixes things. The trauma and stress they have caused me is negligible.

His exact words were ""yes, this is platinum insurance policy and there isn't anyone that doesn't accept it. It's top of the line insurance package."" At over a $1,000 policy I would hope so. So come July when I had to go get my clinical shots I find out that my primary doctor doesn't take my new insurance, my pharmacy, the hospital where I will have to get surgery or my neurosurgeon.

As of today I am still dealing with incorrect billing. I now get paper statements and they still can't get the amount due correct.

Thank God they have Availity. But once your claim is denying incorrectly I bet you will cry to get it reprocess. Their process knowledge is zero, politeness zero.

I even filed a complaint with the insurance board which was absolutely useless. They go out of their way to not pay claims, and most of the time I paid more than they did. This is by far the worst insurance company I have ever had. They just take your money and stick it to you. Last time ever I would have any Blue Cross coverage. In fact, I chose to be uninsured since they are one of the few in the ""Marketplace"". I hope people start reading these reviews so they don't get stuck like I did.",1,BCBS Florida
192,"BCBS of Florida HMO customer service is horrible. They are very rude, incompetent and just downright NASTY. They have hired a bunch of NON-educated baboons! I have seizures and I was showing inactive from their incompetency and couldn't retrieve my seizure medicine from the pharmacy for two weeks! I would like to get out of this contract and go back to UHC. I will seek attorney if need be. Please respond! My mother has the same insurance and she is now inactive for no reason. She needs her heart meds. Guess what? 2 weeks waiting period!",5,BCBS Florida
193,"This company is manipulative. It took part in Government Marketplace in 2016 presenting several plans ""hunting"" for government money and presenting network size for each as network for entire BCBS. When you finally come to the doctor in 2016, you discovered that doctor that was in network upon your signing to the plan actually is not included. I live in Lakeland, Fl. It has major clinic in city, actually only one clinic with full complex of medical services, but that clinic is NOT in the plan they assigned upon signing for the plan. So they offer a bunch of Walk-in clinics with specialist who know how qualified for Primary care... Collecting $800.00 a month for such plan. Specialist - somewhere in 20-30 miles away again in medical facilities without any reputation and questionable liability.",1,BCBS Florida
194,"I received a USB flash drive in the mail from Florida Blue with a letter advising that if I want a paper copy of my Benefits Booklet instead of an electronic one, they will send it upon request. So I called to request it and had to first navigate through that voice mail prompting crap then wait on hold for over 15 minutes for a rep, then the lady I finally spoke with said I could get it online. Duh, that's the purpose of my call. I don't want to get it online. I explained I was promised a paper copy upon request if I called. Don't they train their people? After much back and forth, she told me her computer was down but promised she'd order it and send it. Well, what I received was two more ID cards that I didn't need and no booklet. I'm just one person, why do I need three ID cards? ",1,BCBS Florida

I presented my Florida Blue Select card upon admission to the ER. Later it was determined that I would need a heart stent installed by a Bay Care Group surgeon. Florida Blue Select has refused to pay St. Joseph's Hospital citing they were a out of network provider. At no time was I informed of this information while I was in the ER care nor the procedures which followed.

FIND ANY OTHER PROVIDER for your own sake and and peace of mind. Thanks Mr. Obama for letting corporate america ** its citizens. I will no longer call him Pres. Take a hike Florida Blue and Mr Obama.,1,BCBS Florida
197,I cannot describe how frustrated and upset I am due to the lack of common sense people in the Health Marketplace system has. Marketplace neglected to cancel my previous policy. I got a new insurance for 2016 and had requested cancellation of my old policy for 2015 and now I have two active policies. Florida Blue still sending bills for the previous policy I cancelled. I have spoken to Marketplace twice and they say it will take 30 days to close my previous policy. Besides that the providers are billing the wrong policy even though I updated my insurance information and Florida Blue says I am delinquent with my premium. ,1,BCBS Florida
198,"I started having issues with my health insurance with Blue Cross of Florida since 12/21/2015. They assigned me to an HMO when in fact I wanted to continue with the PPO that I had carried all year long. In January my account started showing that I had 3 policies in effect. I have spent over 65 hrs on the phone for the past 2.5 months trying to fix these issues, spoken to the Marketplace, Blue Cross billing Department, customer service, Supervisors, and still nothing has been done. As a result I couldn't see a Dr during the month of January (paying for a service that I never got).",1,BCBS Florida
199,"The company I retired from had Blue Cross ins. They were out of Maryland. I never had any problems with them if I needed insurance. I moved to Florida three years ago and kept the same ins. When the affordable care act came out my ins dropped me and told me to go to the open market and purchase what I want. I decided to stay with what I had (or so I thought). About two years ago, while I was on my old ins, I had a back injury. The pain was horrible and I tried everything under the sun to help it. After almost two months the doctors finally told me that I would have to have an epidural injection. I wasn't crazy about the idea but I was willing to try anything at that point.",1,BCBS Florida
200,"We purchased Florida Blue through the Marketplace. Before buying the benefits it said ""35 chiropractic services"". Once we got FL BLUE again they confirmed (more than one rep) that we get 35 services. Our chiropractor (and many others in network) are only able to give us 5 adjustments because ASH (the company FL Blue uses for dealing with the claims) denies us after 5 visits. Our chiropractor has 71 other patients with Blue that get denied after 5 as well. When I or my provider try to contact Blue they say, ""You've got 35"", BUT if you contact ASH because they deny anything over 5 adjustments they will give no reason and say they will only disclose info with Blue on the line too! Call Blue and guess what? They won't call ASH with me on the phone or at all. They say it's between ASH and my provider. Sickening.",1,BCBS Florida
201,"How can I complain and get help regarding the terrible service of Florida Blue (BC/BS) health insurance. Since healthcare marketplace has suggested a BCBS plan for us we are struggling. Had to change to a family doctor that we don't want (don't know). All doctors that we had in 12 years are not in network. Even if they state on their website (99% the website doesn't work due to technical error), that a doctor is in their network, when you call to make an appointment it is not true.",1,BCBS Florida

I have made my payments on time and have actually paid more than I should have because of bad information from the marketplace. So here I sit with no insurance after paying literally thousands of dollars, can't pick up much needed prescriptions and am getting invoiced for procedures I had done while I should have been covered. No apology from them even though they admit to mistakenly terminating my coverage. Ready to lawyer up and take these jerks to court. DO NOT GET ON BCBS INSURANCE!!!! I WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE THEM ONE STAR.",1,BCBS Florida
203,"I have tried to use my Blue Cross 3 times and 2 of them are worth telling the public about. The first time was in 2015, I read my plan and saw that I am entitled to 1 physical per year paid by Blue Cross so long as I go to an in network provider. My experience at the doctor was quick and impersonal. About a month later I received a bill from the doctors office saying I need to pay or I will be taken to collections. I immediately payed the $250 then called Blue Cross. ",1,BCBS Florida

Got coverage, paid my first premium BUT... to my surprise... closest doctor is 25 miles away, and the number of doctors is so limited (5) that accept the plan.

We all know all insurance, especially health insurance is a total scam and this is what you get when the insurance companies write Obamacare.",1,BCBS Florida
205,I spent over an hour on the phone with BCBS of Florida in an attempt to cancel my policy. I have spoken to 7 different people and have been given and sent to extensions that are not active multiple times. I am an in-network provider for them and their provider services and personal services are clearly designed to either not pay you or annoy you so much when trying to cancel that you give up trying. Their customer service is subpar and I am quite disappointed. I am glad as of today my money will no longer be lost on them.,1,BCBS Florida
206,"I hurt my spine doing something at home. I was bedridden in complete agony and needed to have a Nerve root block (spinal injection). It has been a week of lying in bed in blinding pain waiting for the preauthorization to go through and I am losing a week's or more of pay from work since I am in too much pain to walk. This is an emergency. I am in bed crying all day from the pain. ERs all refuse to treat back pain because they believe that 100% of people with back pain are drug seekers, therefore the spine doctor is the only option but my insurance will not let me see them.",1,BCBS Florida
207,Wife broke her foot and went to the ER. According to our policy we pay a copayment and ER physicians are covered in full. In the end I had to pay a copayment of 200 and an additional 775 to the hospital that FL blue did not cover. Basically their policy is an outright lie.They paid part of the ER bill but they say the hospital can and did bill separately and that is not covered. So why does their policy claim you pay a copayment and that is all when this is clearly not the case. Their policy makes it seem like you are covered for an emergency but they paid very little of the bill. Obamacare forces us to have BS insurance that pays nearly nothing. I would have been better off to to ask for financial aid from the hospital and received a cheaper price.,1,BCBS Florida
208,I have had IBS-D for many years and in the past 3 years has been more severe. I have Florida Blue insurance through my employer. My prescription plan covers the drug but required prior authorization and limited quantities.

I am puking, dizzy, hurt all over having anxiety attacks panic and attacks and I'm sure my cholesterol is going up as well as my blood pressure.

Before getting coverage we checked on physicians, labs, imaging facilities, etc. However, after becoming Blue, we are BLUED. My main meds are excluded.

All people in waiting room had bottled water or was offered it right in front of me! We never had it offered. I told her they have no manners/upbringing. They finally see me & not in the computer.

I had to pay today a self-pay payment because no one would give them a definite answer on my copayment which has always been 20.00 a visit. I called, they put me on hold and never picked up the phone. This is ridiculous. I pay my premium, I deserve fair treatment. They owe me 110.00 out of my pocket that I shouldnt had to pay.",1,BCBS Florida

Couldn't be farther from the truth. I was told on TWO diff accounts I was covered for an implant contraceptive. Come to find out after waiting for 2 weeks they rejected my request. After more phone calls, additional hours on hold, three ""let me forward you to so and so's"", I finally found out that no, I was not covered for my preferred type of contraceptive. ",1,BCBS Florida

After reading reviews here, we changed our coverage to Humana, who we have had for years. Their premium for Medicare Advantage was $0 and Florida Blue was to be $450 per month. When we called to cancel the Florida Blue plan, they transferred us to an 800 number for DISH network. We tried again and were able to cancel. Including reimbursement for our Part A and B, we will save nearly $10,000 a year. Nice work for an afternoon.",1,BCBS Florida
218,"Blue Select is a joke. Blue Cross just wants you to sign up that's it. The ""provider lists"" that their own representative give are out of date. When you call the doctors on the list many of the doctors claim they do not accept Blue Select! Months go by and the lists don't get updated even when you call to complain. What anyone other industry would call false and misleading. If the provider lists are so limited then simply say so and don't tell members the ""lists"" are up to date. At least consumers can make an informed decision.",1,BCBS Florida

I called to get information 3 times before they gave me a short list of NON pediatric orthopedic offices! I since had my son removed and it's now taking me 5 calls and three weeks to get him removed off this bogus plan! I called today to get a list of ob-gyns since nobody takes Florida Blue and the agent rushed me off the phone saying she emailed me the list.

Then, as a result of Obamacare, I was able to get coverage with Florida Blue who then spent the next two years denying coverage (appeals and all) for treatment of the same pre-existing condition that I still have and that should have been cured by now! What is it the French say? ""The more things change, the more they remain the same."" Maybe the U.S. will take a page from the more evolved Europeans and move to a public option, because the capitalist greed of health care providers (a proven misnomer) prevents the patient from attaining needed treatment, and at sky-high premiums nonetheless! Stay away from the whores at Florida Blue!",1,BCBS Florida
221,My pediatric patient with an elbow fracture had to be seen through the ER instead of in an orthopedic clinic as no pediatric orthopedists are covered by Florida Blue Select within a 50 mile radius of Tampa Bay!!

222,"I had Florida Blue for 2.5 years through marketplace for $600 a month (female over 50) plus I wanted the best coverage with little to no deductibles since I had just divorced and money especially extra money is a commodity. For 2 years no complaints. Coincidentally no procedures either. I received notice 11/2014 that they no longer were offering my plan and the one replacing it just happen to cost approx $150 more a month. I really saw no other differences in the plan except the hospital I use was no longer in network, nice. ",1,BCBS Florida

The thought of fighting this battle for the next 5 years is beyond mind boggling.",1,BCBS Florida
224,"I have had major surgery. Florida Blue would not coordinate at ALL with the hospitals and doctors/surgeons to estimate what my payments should be. They were well aware of all of the procedures in advance, but insisted that WE work with the different providers to ensure that we did not overpay. (It was obvious that our out of pocket maximum was going to be met). They will not coordinate with the pharmacies either - they are constantly telling US to call Caremark if there are questions.

I was informed that I ""should have"" called 9/30 because now I ""unfortunately"" have coverage until 10/31... and BTW, they are KEEPING my $644 premium despite my NOT WANTING this insurance to the end of the month. I also cancelled Dental- no problem there getting my ENTIRE premium back! By the way, I didn't have a new job until October 1, so I couldn't call them on 9/30! I instructed my bank to REFUSE the charge since the charge was UNAUTHORIZED and also I will be writing to my Congressional reps to seek their assistance in getting back my $644 and also ensure that the TV stations in my area broadcasts.

I had place in under online for automatic deduction, but was mailed statements for $249 a month, then increase to $689 a month. On my birthday in September, I received a termination letter, then a check. I rather want my insurance. Why the increase in monthly statements? The original quote for deductions was $4000, but on statements, deductions was now $6000 in network, without an explanation. Was it due to my age or fact I had a stroke?",3,BCBS Florida
227,"I had outpatient surgery on 7/9/2014. After paying over $2,000 out of pocket for the different doctors, assistants, anesthesia, supplies, etc. I received a bill from the hospital for $23,000+. I contact BCBS about the bill and found that BCBS denied the claim for 'lack of medical records' on 8/9/14. An EOB was generated on 8/21/14. The same claim was adjusted for payment on 8/26/14. Another EOB was generated on 9/11/14. The same claim was adjusted on 11/24/14 but there was no change in payment so no EOB was issued. The claim was again adjusted on 4/14/15 but again no change in payment so no EOB. The claim was adjusted again on 7/7/15 which reduced the payment BCBS paid from $2795 to $1988. ",1,BCBS Florida

Out of the blue, they sent me a letter threatening me with cancellation for premium nonpayment unless I immediately sent them the sum of $0.01. That's right, one penny. They thoughtfully scheduled my payment to be deducted on the last day of the month. For many, this could be a real inconvenience. Who wouldn't realize that when implementing it? They owe me for two payments they took out of my account in error. After numerous complaints, instead of refunding the money, they send me a letter saying they will send it via some adjustments next year. Comes next year, they tell me my plan is no longer available. And of course, I never see the refund. ",1,BCBS Florida
229,It is apparent what Florida Blue is doing to cope with the federal mandate of accepting people with pre-existing conditions that they would not have accepted before. They are deliberately minimizing support to an unacceptable level then burying you in delays and paperwork when you appeal. Practically every person dealt with has been incompetent. This is why corporations need to be regulated.,1,BCBS Florida

When there are discrepancies and miscommunications with my policy, which happens at least twice a month, it is an hour+ ordeal to get a human being with a brain on the phone, and they are usually not at all helpful.

231,I am so disappointed with Florida Blue blue select. I have filed numerous complaints trying to resolve the many issues I have with this plan. It looked great in December 2014 when I chose it and paid for it. I have never been treated this bad by any company or person for that matter in my life. I am expected now to travel 150 miles to see Dr's they want me to see. Did I mention they shortened their provider list by 95%?,1,BCBS Florida
232,"On December the 31st, 2014 I went online as usual to make my payment. I was unable to do so since the policy that was supposed to start on 1-1-15 had a cancellation of 12-31-2014. It took more than two months to sort this issue out. Florida Blue contacted The Market Place on a conference call to find out which cancellation date The MP had and were able to confirm that in effect the cancellation date was for 12-31-2015 making it a ""typo"" error on FB side. From that moment forward my insurance cancels twice a month every month. I send payments. They keep being refunded back to me. I am told constantly to wait two more days and by now we are in the middle of July and still have the same issue. One employee once told me that ""the Obamacare has many issues and we knew it would not work."" I was appalled because I found it to be a highly political comment.",1,BCBS Florida
233,Terrible insurance with policy! I feel like I got duped into paying for a policy with no real benefits - however since it was forced on the America people via Obamacare I decided to try and get something for my money instead of paying an ever increasing penalty for not having insurance.

After months asking for my refund they told me they applied part of the amount to my new policy. I said I never authorized that or ask for it. They said they would refund me the whole amount. I waited the 10 days they said it would take and when I called back they said they cannot refund me the whole money because they used it to pay my next month, which is not due yet! The service rep I spoke to made a mistake and asks the refund from the old account and because it was closed and the money was transferred to my new account, they did nothing! Now they say they cannot refund me all the money, but that's fine, I'm already paid a month in advance. The thing is that I'm paying for her employee mistake. I know the money is there, but I need it with me. They don't know my finances.",1,BCBS Florida

Finally, they told me I could only get a refund if I were deceased or if I had faxed proof of the new policy 15 days before my account was debited on the 1st (I didn't have proof of the new policy until AFTER my account was debited).

How in the hell gives the insurance company the right to play God??? They can't... I have now been talking to a woman that has been in the billing for insurance coding for the last 31 years, and she is so pissed off that Blue Cross in doing this to us!!! This is against the law and just because Blue Cross is so ** behind, does not mean that we (the patient) have to pay.

Loopholes, verifications, authorizations --- and even then it is a crap shoot whether they pay or play. Florida Blue is utter hubris bordering on malfeasance.

What's crazy is we had Blue Cross Blue Shield before, just plain old Blue Cross Blue Shield. We had great insurance. In four years I never had to call customer service once. But in the past nine months I've gotten more medical bills than I have in the past five years combined - and we're actually going to the doctor less!
